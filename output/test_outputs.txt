You know that what I do is I write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in America.
And I always tell people that I don't want a scientist.
I can describe it as a farmer, or with leather clothes and never no one has chosen a farmer.
Today I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that fell somewhere in place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the men's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I allowed her to go into the bathroom <unk>
I did it in secret, it.
For three years, for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the 1920s, and I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that teacher, the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
And I'm sure that we did adults never get to know us.
You could join Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to join you, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and we were taking care of her family, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as the adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of your life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and <unk> and it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans who are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can, quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water -- almost 60 feet, and I couldn't longer think that it was a <unk> of snow on a year <unk> a year after year.
<unk> are born when they come from the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> which are isolated apart and themselves, as much as we see ourselves as human beings.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> is to melt a <unk> I'm breathing your <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg as an iceberg releases water rich in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come up close to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique times there are that way and they will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its path for life cycle.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's <unk> to actually get a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg of Greenland, <unk>
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we cut the iceberg shows a different side of her personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each one -- a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to make it too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about conception -- I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X chromosome goes into the X chromosome <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground activity to have two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people start out of anatomy -- that means human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with a lot more low than the average average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with sex -- individuals whose physical <unk> don't fit into the white <unk> and conventional female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that is not <unk> in the common forms or male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which gene <unk> and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life -- that we all have in life <unk> that will come back.
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes will make testosterone.
But because this guy lacks no testosterone, your body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So, high testosterone levels but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developed following a <unk> course, a <unk> course.
When you look at the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And after doing tests you realize that instead of having ovaries, and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome.
What's important to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I -- I consider a <unk> woman -- I don't know its <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman most women as I am sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from an <unk> <unk> <unk> who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life like a boy and he had just found out that he had ovaries, and she was somebody.
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus <unk> the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman on it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th machines develop what is known as <unk> which is to say, have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies would be <unk> twins, or <unk> twins and <unk> <unk> surgeries -- not to be able to have any better physical health of a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they were <unk> several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together, a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- <unk> black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you come up with a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very excited ideas in our culture to <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in a same body.
The highest case of last year is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the <unk> of their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to be able to figure out if you're <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go further through science, we have to admit that these <unk> categories were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> <unk> categories are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the terminology is going on.
So as we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved on, in science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are fights at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There's really <unk> discussions today on the audience, not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to get married with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would put up a pen in front of the nose and if he moved still not to it.
If I stopped moving it out of it.
But we can, for example, extract organ organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of determining really someone's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories might be going to be someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
And so that these categories are far more fragile than we were thinking about it.
It comes from the idea of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find every bit of watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that the political power was coming into the right of the <unk> the father and then to the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They set up the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered to be the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time we have a science <unk>
And it remains very clear, if you look at the story of <unk> <unk> that many were really interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to go through a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And on a result, they were broadcasting us the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
So again, people in color that are going on to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and, again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we had to focus on anatomy.
I don't want to say that at five years they were supposed to allow you to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, in contrast, was born in the contrary, was born the March March 1 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary are attributed to all three months before Henry <unk> right to Henry sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because he was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, for virtue of being considered a man -- if I have not told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man <unk> from the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
They do not have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still <unk> <unk> categories that in many ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided to get married with a man -- you don't have to have chromosome and get married with a woman you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't make tests <unk> people.
But this is also very strange by the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If we looked at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I mean, "Yes, the idea seems to be <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> decisions.
So how do you get the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue this current thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who is attracted to other men is <unk> to be killed by <unk> unless they are willing to submit to a sex change in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon of a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that had made a couple of years ago to give birth twins and then pick up their <unk>
But when the phone asked the reason for the <unk> he was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it has considered political asylum.
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are without <unk> to change the entire state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up I want to say I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater involvement to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> particularly if there are people thinking in a group.
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in research the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered to be <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
What about female has the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I have heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the <unk> of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I have thought about his question, more of me has seemed like there's something else in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were so easily able to find the way to protect people from the state, is possible that we could have become more attached to this concept, you might have enriched the concept of protection for the <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we have to make democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to go live and work -- have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their construction cost.
So we could easily heal the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they simply went through the buildings of apartments.
Imagine half the people who wanted to live in apartments already and in the other half you can still get them to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the footsteps of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, build a whole new apartment building completely new, always and when the rules of that place would be able to get it to <unk>
So I proposed that governments were going to build new major reform zones of large enough to contain cities and gave them a name, under <unk> cities.
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 percent, they would walk out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following regular elections -- <unk> <unk> gave them a platform in which he promised to reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
They have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of the technologies to kind of <unk> rules for <unk> and usually the rules that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a bond with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go and talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and you have to start with a site which is about 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were really serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And we also had new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with the countries associated with the help to establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all be trusted.
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily able to take a thousand square miles.
And soon after the 19th of January, you voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow us to create these special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional <unk> was <unk>
All the games, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
<unk> in the Constitution has to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February was passed over to another voting and <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that's building in Korea <unk> is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after you spent four years getting <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in practical ways, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow those <unk> and then to the time they could operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new organizational system.
There's urban planners and builders who are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already figured out is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is in the second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
They allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money is going to be good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
I love <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would take for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all that I put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I want to use after you come to Palm <unk>
And they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new food.
Let's start with the Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be in bad humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people you don't just get to you, you can also tell you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you have in it.
And sometimes people tell me that it seems like I'm playing <unk> or I remind them of their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're okay with something, it's almost secure you are.
And if you think you don't see something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person inside you inside and outside, you don't have a look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to be six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique lifestyle is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversation.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to get emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> crazy, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if we take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone that's completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them are wandering through one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need quite a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them, and then we see how <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As some of the intuition that you may have developed with the past step is the one that says one thing can be just one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing on a parking ticket.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet you play with that bar <unk> I showed him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars with parking bars play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics.
At that point he was the physics of a few years ago, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That won't be very good at my intuition, and maybe it's because they're not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But they don't really feel good at my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be all of the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why he shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to expand this a little bit. It's just right in the center.
And then here we make a good approach to small <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a sense of springboard and <unk> in a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and then put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> a swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it's in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, weird things, but then when other people goes up to make those things, because I don't want to bother you, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> teammates of inanimate objects are not only people -- it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind moving around and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
And then you get the lights down, then you get a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then we put it down to a temperature of less than a degree above zero zero.
Now, when it's only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and it was vibrating. And the way it comes in, was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when you give him a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make that metal piece are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in particular <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> worth in a clean room to do this for all those years, because watch this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that metal little metal is roughly the same as the difference between the metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places. Why don't you too?
I mean, it's my piece of logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just going on in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, which is here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
Many negotiations and stories, they will be able to do it with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There are a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story explains just in this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the reality of making it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So I would better show you that I can then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So, <unk> we go to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get it up.
They want to navigate by the <unk>
We open the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
Keep to go ahead and go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the sign of <unk>
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm clicking right here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you can do with 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I walked into and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
So I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I learned something about it.
And now we're going to get more deep in depth and you'll see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move off the image, so you see what there is.
So here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just <unk> around.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, you send your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all the incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its artwork and that is represented online.
And the great question that do me today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel flying
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm about Italian, <unk> all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I show you this is something really interesting about <unk> careers in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, take a budget and put it into a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering, we have a control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that systems of control in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going back to the free air.
And as <unk> they're beginning to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the world's cortex -- but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, over the summer.
It's called <unk> uncle, <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms will become sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
It was almost like in the old dream of <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end he took the hammer and he was dumped by Moses -- -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said <unk> <unk> In fact, what did not do <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see it in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
On the late early there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they were all at the center of the winning team and the first minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but things we use and consume them.
Today, we know all about the side of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a few little tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are in <unk>
Then we put a little chip, and we put them a little tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
This is from <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening complicated things and there's a lot of transportation transportation.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we dropped not disappears, that it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle is still there still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public spaces in architecture in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, you will join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop was imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a underwater, water pixels with water.
If the pixels can be written on them, show patterns, images -- <unk>
And the curtain is, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to Mayor <unk>
I loved it.
And we took a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you get to come up and open so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building, and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
And there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you get down almost all the architecture it's gone.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> so it goes in.
And here I'm myself trying not to go back and test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually more fun even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact with it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was opening up to let you happen, but a building that was still making <unk> and holes, and one had to jump into not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because the architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and every one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw earlier, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, a cloud of it.
So a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, and different types of resolution.
And that then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet today, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment -- like a <unk> farm like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could just make it a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable that has happened in the last two decades, is that in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We have digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time, and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, from the power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud they're <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move around, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve <unk> by a more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe they're those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is they going to tell you?
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do we do creativity?
Hands up your hand.
<unk> probably was the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED conference -- but I want to give you a glimpse of a doctor on the subject.
The great 20th century, the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called <unk> in biology -- makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the one that interests you.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
We have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that uses to treat <unk>
This is not like insulin insulin -- but it's the same protein, it's chemically <unk> from the pancreatic side.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize we all take in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when do you say -- when Antonio <unk> makes you think about it, you think about <unk>
So the gut is a wonderful environment for those bacteria.
It's warm -- dark rooms is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to do without the effort of their part.
It really is like a fast way for bacteria with occasional <unk> of some hasten <unk> towards the output.
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect them against certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique <unk> a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I first brought to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two daughters.
But when organisms come up, things start to change.
It goes on at the scene of sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the onset of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have a confession to a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every single time had more doubt.
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits their door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a beautiful <unk> dancer, of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> look for a <unk> <unk>
It's good," he says George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily quite different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to take us healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to go through the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of how ordered rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we will let us fall into the sea.
I think all of you who are <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to warn you, not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily save longevity.
They don't necessarily take the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only survival test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if they had fish there, dry fish in the empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the reasoning that would be that would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as we species, we have <unk> our environment for us to become <unk> as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to happen in evolution.
A second possibility is that a evolution of the traditional kind of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but are <unk>
And as soon as we have a kind of <unk> as a species -- distant planets, are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution.
But there's a third possibility, a serious possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's actually worth the individual and family level.
Just think that if you could be able not only to choose not only the sex of its <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could do genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes are going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 million base pairs of the human genome at a cost at the cost of 20,000 and a week.
There is not a lot of a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and it's getting more and more and more in reach of all.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they're going to meet other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu grown into cells from a plant from <unk>
You can imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is getting more and more possible.
Imagine only one other little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and giving their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminating diabetes -- reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology is that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to outsource this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have became the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We are going to use these options in a more successful society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose selectively attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust, and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom you need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what it might be <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're in 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to your flight assistants <unk>
So he immediately looked at the looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. I probably <unk> some <unk>
And the pilot had already walked the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot ran the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the <unk>
Let's take the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight flight.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I got a sentence, which is <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is <unk> the George Washington, which was not a lot of -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've been trying to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity as I also give my ego.
And I'm going to do the time that I would take in things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as I did that, in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I am no longer trying to have no reason to get <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break into 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I started, I had the feeling of, <unk> will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been striving for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to have my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- the first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understood the two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good father.
I was a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave myself another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You are flying in today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you in your plane -- and please don't be that -- but imagine and how do you start?
What is it that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I clearly have been blessed in life with many projects.
But the greatest thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and he said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he's able to communicate to me."
And I said, "A second, is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important, and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Did anybody see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they'll make it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I teamed up with his brother and her father right there at that particular moment -- "OK, this is the <unk> Tony <unk> going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside you can't afford it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer they draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, and then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a life cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of an organization and a lot to move things from one side to another one we had a couple of things.
One one, you touch the doors of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that you could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't do it. This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the corner of every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid and when they were born, they would have removed the frames of the walls and instead would have <unk>
But for two weeks old, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of glasses of cheap sun, we bought on the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some wire wire and <unk> <unk> and <unk> Radio
We took a <unk> camera <unk> we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up the code, we published the software <unk> the software is <unk> free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming all the night, Tony started drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall from the outside of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were having the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and someone finally came to <unk> and get me out there so that I could get it on.
It's not <unk>
So in a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go through with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
We've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time recognized us as one of the top 50 invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up of closing <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in downtown Los Angeles going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it happen.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I am not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel that we have to do. If it's not right now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years ago in situations generally very difficult and at the same time a bit dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
Back in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days to eat only this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible situations with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that we have <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that became cool and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the name of my TED TEDTalk -- 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what and according to content in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity for me.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy your name.
If you had asked me a year ago if you would have been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film I'm working on, we tested the marketing world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could tell me anything that was so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about <unk> of products, and marketing and advertising, and that all the film will be <unk> with product <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The biggest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest film ever <unk> is that all over the top at the end, has kind of <unk> all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title -- the <unk> brand.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so I filmed this film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is what? <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the brand X in the title -- but we're going to make sure we are <unk> all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we get a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you had.
The most cool car you have in "The largest film has ever been <unk> the best <unk> you've got <unk> from "The biggest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And actually we show the full process of how it works.
The objective of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, and the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> Don't <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One and a <unk> <unk> Very <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard at meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be a couple of big steps.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out and look at us as a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or for me.
JK: So both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I get <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And it was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was introducing the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media stage and the stage of the media, not the idea of that new vehicle worth of attention, which is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually no, there was such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google --  -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or easily <unk> or easily <unk> or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last single problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really change suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you --  -- like that rare bear still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this little <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want the story to be <unk>
We want them to take a story, but we want to <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in a lie -- and he's looking at me as he was saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's a real-time story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the proxy and go to the companies I would have to go to companies and go to companies and I would go to business myself.
So what I started to see is that what I started to see is that when you start to talk to the business of the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giant giants and others who make films small, independent <unk> like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the marks associated with them.
And then my friends who make these independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, big giant <unk>
And the film is called "The biggest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say, "Are you well cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You're a little nervous.
I want to help you tell you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he would offer one of these crazy <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, <unk> on bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
We put into the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we're rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, you know, to remind people is the reason why we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something beautiful, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category on positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps it cool.
How do you keep you fresh, better than better <unk> more than <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: I get my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
I usually wear as sunglasses, or like the <unk> and I like <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call her <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: And partly partly partly <unk> in part -- <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They make toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Nation <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm brand <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be this brand of Tom, Tom, but often <unk> me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These people make my way to see the world.
A: <unk> from that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you can think about it, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All those things come back and start in a place and in my case, and in my case, and they start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is my best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things. I like the weird stuff.
A: <unk> from <unk> to what does that do for us?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Let's get a little bit about that.
It's slightly more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> Have you <unk>
You don't have to be fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was so much crazy in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your <unk> personality, <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were getting very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only be embedded in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid the fear of those items, and you actually get them to stand up and make it become a little positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classical, Apple.
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands -- those things that have gone and come out, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity on brand, your personality <unk> what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> attribute to you.
slightly more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dominant magical or mystical of <unk>
Or are you more of attribute to <unk>
You're conscious -- sophisticated like <unk>
You're traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're reliable a stable family, reliable sure, sacred, <unk> or wise of the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for a movie of film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are going to be going into the schools with the problems of the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects where I've had the most successful response or the ones that I've been most successful is the ones that I have to do with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with it to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does he gone? They succeed?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million media media to this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies we talk about, they will tell their customers not to be part of it.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that, they're pushing it to failure.
I think that when you train your employees in loss aversion is preparing their entire business for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to do is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we go forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- the peril.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to be able to use transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> <unk> has been presented for my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So let's take a name for transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check from the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation, the <unk> Foundation, to be applied to my assistance for TED <unk>
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a effective computer virus in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I know is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> -- the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That was called us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we would <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very weird things.
It was <unk> as a laboratory rat who didn't like our <unk> that wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk>
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It could be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
We better put the goal soon.
And then we pulled out of the attack, and we found the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
We would take all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much it would look the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above all of what we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at was called the beginning of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to deal with it with the real world, with potential potential for the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it is definitely a violent, <unk> must be a blank white, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I showed them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that part of a cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the attack of the attack was doing slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to make the engineers <unk> so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> shows in that code, you can't afford it.
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better at it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had in your hands.
It wasn't like it was like this.
The results have been taken away after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> they would say to one single goal, but from different <unk>
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't need to worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that I saw really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of sensors for example, of pressure sensors and <unk> and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false <unk> data.
And believe it or not, these <unk> input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the <unk>
Is it really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the large steam turbines is going on speed, you have to open <unk> valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator, obviously.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system will <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, <unk> with <unk> of uranium.
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the gravitational superpower, here.
There is one alone -- and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give <unk> skills or another one that makes users out of wheelchair raise up and go walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different than something that goes on in the morning, it gives you a great force that is also going to increase its speed, and help you manage the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But it's not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
In order to show you now what we're working on -- we start talking about the American soldier who, on average, must carry on its back a load of 45 pounds, and it's being allowed to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions in the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage on the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can rotate it to 90 percent of the data for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and a resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair chairs about what I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people roughly, in <unk> all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with very often, very young people, with damage in the column that when you start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury in the <unk> column and as a result couldn't go back to 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors ...
completely not <unk> in the crutches that they send the TV signals on board on the back.
Now there are some batteries that give power to the motors on the <unk> and in the knees, and they do it for this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing over the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything from hip down.
Soon a long time later, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said to me, "You will never be going to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last ounce of hope of my self.
The adaptation technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it down on <unk> scale rocks and even ride on a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, all the users of wheelchair to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex with sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives, closest <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot too focused on what our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos are showing us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where death death has not ever observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of big apes.
They live in the depths of the jungle <unk> and it has been very difficult to go.
Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost so many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also <unk> the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation makes you can't fill in not a stadium with the bonobos that are left in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden by <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that like the <unk> apes love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish ties and foster <unk>
And with him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo is you see the roots of your laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
Just I think in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is both in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the same time is most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with water <unk>
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that the Bonobo are given us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world to greater and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's take it to the maximum capacity of our ability in it.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems like the less appropriate to play, they can be the times as the most <unk>
So fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as they turn creativity, and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of a captain in a <unk> body, volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers have highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance of going.
But there was still a race on the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just got before I was before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to walk and would save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a fan of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a <unk> building to save a live live just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need to be able to do it <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I did it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, he went to the firemen -- which is that at the end of the hall, he went to the <unk> that had gone off the fire and walked into the room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my back to the staircase and I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the main door.
We got out of the house of the house for the house of home where, as you would expect, his treasure.
A few weeks later the department had a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she watched for the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as I am in my calling I'm noticing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage on individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or are the <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you of this.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park park.
It's mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So he trained to <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block of concrete.
The first blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules of a fixed measure of a fixed measure that fit in.
Very quickly, these became the longest construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He called the <unk> brick brick
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that we've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block that the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex circuits at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're linked by magnets.
So you can't place it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the pink is the <unk> and the orange color is the wire.
So only you can assemble a blue one with green and very quickly you can start making older circuits.
A blue one in green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it faster or slower -- you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a growing.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get into the world <unk>
It turns out, sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light like a night light, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers had no experience in electronics in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  So a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island School who don't have any experience in engineering, just and wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, an <unk> barrel in motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that has a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach out of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and make things.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar hospital.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I was a term of time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
We put some members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World <unk> we send them the wild world.
They worked with big <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
And when it's a parking lot in Boston.
Here it shows as if I would find a quote, but what you really find is somebody's <unk> when you get caught up because they know it's not very good by putting up fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did I get to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we were going to spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that <unk> citizens with shovels right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You're embracing <unk>
When I do that, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can tell you.
So it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But something that has no other governance technology technology.
It spreads <unk>
A responsible for <unk> systems, when we saw this application realized that I could use it, not for snow, but so the citizens of <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work on these <unk> of tsunami, but people were steals the batteries.
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to get people out to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we know nine cities that we should be using using it.
And this has been <unk> not <unk> <unk>
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by the normal canals would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power justice of California that even the time has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of shot shot to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the self of the Internet.
I mean, without <unk> in a way open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a big frustration that they have to do -- but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of politics -- line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they were alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government <unk>
And because the last ultimately comes from us -- you remember that from <unk> the way that it will affect the way that it will affect change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of services and information center.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> in the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a web and mobile and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that application.
It was the very clever work of the New York City of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this actually came up this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went around the <unk> I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical ones.
And it's also a great example of government income to private volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to go and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could be <unk> connected with government services, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, let's get the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input to the other.
That our input system is a <unk>
How many times have you chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and we need our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow superficial layer.
So below it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that contempt of what keeps us from that that we funded as something that we funded on our against that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy <unk>
Because this is where the real government works.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizen citizens that have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> to the financial reform.
That's not political activism that's not political activism.
And for which we have <unk> ourselves to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the tremendous challenges that they have to face.
Do you really think we're going to get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't do government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is about 28 years, so I am, I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express your opinions in any same time and they do it.
So when you face the government problem you don't really care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the work to the work to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> pulling out <unk> dumping out a garbage bucket that has a <unk> inside.
We certainly were able to get cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are kind of a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we're going to be a swarm of voices, or we'll also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in community communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing about these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach themselves with feeling, you can have special meaning.
A doctor can do things good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right -- my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in all of the discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery was born as a way to see the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe, and then I <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I was like, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I would love again and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was about 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years, I woke up a morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at her and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took me from my hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now let me do not <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do anything."
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "I want you to give me three things, right?
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right thing if the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother and older than one sister a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I didn't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just get the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today, you always do the same thing.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I cut off with force and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren who are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I'm saying it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we do with it, according to it, and we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black communities are so <unk> so these are a determined by these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all young people in prison are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is a lot better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems like ours.
We are <unk>
I think it's interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some rather curious.
In my state, in Alabama, like in the other states, you would care about rights if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost definitely the right vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before you <unk> the law of the right vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where was sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no chance to come back.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they have taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the crimes of <unk> but if we <unk> to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by error.
Out of every nine people who have identified one who is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A <unk> rate, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine you would have had a <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we <unk>
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and lasted for World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what their lives defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, makes <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our story to deal with the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we get to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without a compromise with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, before the genocide had this engagement, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany speaking about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very <unk> to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> is not worth of death in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and one lady said, "No way for our story, we can never get into a systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> we put people to <unk>
I think about this.
How do we engage in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. Let's bring creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
lately we're talking about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that never come to TED.
So thinking about them -- in a way, something that's within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
But in innovation, with creativity is not only about brain ideas.
These things come out of ideas that are <unk> also for the banks of the heart.
This connection of mind connection is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I think, than even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no related <unk> to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, and to <unk> inequality, in injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity, than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege of being a young lawyer who had met Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. lady, called me to go, <unk> comes to me, <unk> -- we're going to come together to speak.
You want to come up and go.
I said, "I know lady. I know <unk>
So she would say, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I gave him <unk>
So I was going down and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, please tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
So what you're trying to do to do."
And I started giving it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We're trying to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up the sentences for life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and at the end of it looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out of <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be too much, but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher than the worst thing we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't tell you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> you don't have to judge our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, just like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond me in a very important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, that they have been <unk> for adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge convert to someone in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
I was very late in my late evening, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, it must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has <unk>
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> a tiny, poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my black <unk> was treated as a privileged white <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I found that there had been a <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or actually <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> but he had been sent to court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten that.
And finally, my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. Going to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- he was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. Is you <unk> I said yes.
So I approached myself and <unk>
And I told myself in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
He came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> <unk> And we started now."
People started to go. Everyone was <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
The cops have the cops <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. We all love it, because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and you'll hear all that <unk>
You can walk over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with the face of concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> assistant showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> walked over the old black black.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up and looked at me and he looked at me and he said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young man that keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> of hearing and see an obvious desire in the audience, in this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities there.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in policy policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases, <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are brought to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say, what would you think that is?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes of violence.
It's about the wrong War on drugs.
That's why this is a dramatic increase in the industrialized population.
And we let ourselves convince you for the rhetoric from punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> to steal a bicycle, a bicycle, for a little crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you been excited now here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats for Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses get a lot of more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And because nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop all of those data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
So this is why a <unk> of stories would have to look at the <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news for the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe what happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is embedded in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the species of species, the water <unk> and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are really good at <unk> problems and, in the long run, we just had them.
Let's take the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average life has more than <unk> income per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy spent 25 to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> television, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
We have a lot of this technology and lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you put in technology technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price for about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things in this curve.
First, how soft it is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It is the outcome of quick computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, you go up to the top.
The growth rate of technology is getting faster and faster.
And in this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computing in the cloud, my friends in <unk> call computing computing and sensors and networks, the robotic printing and their ability to democratize personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the vaccines and the food, the digital biology, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays the nuanced of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everybody on the phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or a service or a service that can affect something positively <unk>
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, it would have <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each other's dweller is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the <unk> king of <unk>
The Napoleon troops ate with <unk> <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the <unk> to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though the aluminum is the Earth's mass of the Earth, it doesn't come out of the <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and it made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It took this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet hanging out of 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about heartbreak but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
So let's talk about wars for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed up the Voyager towards the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
You have a famous picture -- how do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent for water.
Yes, the <unk> is seawater, two percent is ice, and we fight by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology that is available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you that you gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> already <unk> is the size of a small fridge in a child.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> saltwater, saltwater, drinking water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just thought that I'm going to do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which this way -- Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it on cell phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile cellphones in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan about 25 years ago.
And, of course, with a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted ever.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video -- images of books and music, technology technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to when you get the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the world teams so that we have these technologies in a mobile device that you talk about, and because it has <unk> you can get rid of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be <unk> to call the health care and, first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the largest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just got the mark of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion, is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion of the Internet users.
Three billion minds of minds have never been able to get into the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you want? What desires.
And instead of an economic collapse we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And most of the health care is because of the <unk> of a better education in the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about a few voices ever <unk>
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to act for the first time?
What would these 3,000 billion?
And if they're the contributions we can't afford to.
One of the things I learned with the X is that it's small, guided by her passion with a goal of course, they can do things that were before they could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folding determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came on and started <unk>
And it has shown that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we have been excited to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You probably think that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red List of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times in the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special thing.
But the case is that we still come around the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another feedback, the shift from the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a Lagos in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
It was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see from a few mangroves.
There were about 20 feet, the <unk> of black.
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there, 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> to the five inches.
We would have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty <unk> called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea, and above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> I now know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was coral, other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs tiny <unk> about <unk> remains of coral reefs.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The background of being a solid coral fund -- in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
I once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to get it, because it was good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But it has no <unk>
<unk> the world, we don't remember it.
They took the starting point to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes, because people do things with <unk>
Every generation is going to use images received in the beginning of their conscious life as normal, and I extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the results of changes.
And at the end of keeping it with a few <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or not that they were gone.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before they're <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focused on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become little prevalent because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you know, as to talk to me as to see a lot of fish in this area can't be used, or generally they don't use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on sources of the past.
There is a huge role that can accomplish a protected zone.
Because with marine areas we actually have protected the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has been running and very low.
That's for people who can see a marine protected zone and can benefit from vision that allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do that because they have no access, like the people in the West -- for example?
I think that art and cinema may fill in <unk> The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> harbor 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were moved with film <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, have been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends of <unk> and I look at YouTube in a professional form.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made of viral and what's important about it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- it seemed something very, very difficult.
But today, the website makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And, of those, just a small percentage of those, it takes lots of <unk> and he makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things of trends, communities of engaging with surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> on the rise of popularity last summer.
They didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this story that <unk> the video.
<unk> like Jimmy <unk> presented us with new things and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  On Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   I all want you to get on the end of a week, the weekend of a week.   You know, I won't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday one.
Well, I took it off, and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a creators of trends will take a point of view, and they share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big joke -- then starting to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an analog animation with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there's cats that you saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up among the Internet community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an ancient version of this.
And then they became international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community emerged -- that made this going to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> and <unk> or Black or Black <unk>
What script might have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two video days per minute, just that truly unique and unexpected thing can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who was protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit, I didn't really feel interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was hanging out by <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you alive for the <unk>
KA: Thank you for the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made it five million watched and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth of everything again that we do <unk>
And this is all led to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of tendency, creative creative communities, fully unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- to a new culture, that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of popularity that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally on vain.
The words, for so much time friends, now I <unk>
They become a silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother had never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I would have it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a marriage marriage and two small girls are.
For her, life had been devoted to a task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a four year-old <unk> that defies fiction, a boat kicked out to the European Aral Sea.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of people were the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If I first took it first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I can remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, end up the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried to, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants from.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence -- in <unk> there was no sense of right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and that was an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was sitting in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were telling us about our day and we heard the motions of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had been <unk>
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares are going to start in order to be able to make it <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry transition and angry and <unk> boys in between two worlds.
It was looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student with what <unk> myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in life -- tragically, <unk> by violence, substance abuse and isolation.
But many were given help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected by the Chinese <unk> of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of it will not happen.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life on a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she came up to the ship.
The "no" ever had ever been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What not <unk>
So I talked about youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more I speak, the more I was talking about it, to talk about it.
I met people from all of the roads in life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And although I finished my job I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown stranger, a new ones on the scene -- and not only that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an unhealthy optimism -- a rare kind of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
I went to a little group of people for the people who can't <unk> it was a serious challenge for me.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot pot of soup that all of the <unk>
<unk> up to fine entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ones, and we open up step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have been wrong.
I was in the shower in the quarter of a hotel in Sydney when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell stories and ensure that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to get her hand.
I asked her to <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life we were built now we can see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that to know?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing to do.
Can I give you a <unk> in their lives, it's a brave of each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them, you do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky sky, with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
We do it with airplanes.
At that time, when <unk> the great prince warrior goes, I had <unk> and I had <unk> and with a bow on the ground, he could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was going to tell me so much.
I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was telling myself this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tell my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not to kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket silver <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that cell phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it out.
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I threw this technology world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of her.
I read books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device that could connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
So bringing the text together with the image, and it animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  he says, "This box belongs to me, I write my name.
And so I get back a character in the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live with GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that magic of childhood, those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we need to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, you light your way into what it activates the book.
Another idea that fascinated me about a little girl was that a whole galaxy would fit in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I <unk> into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create an Indian content and in contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts -- <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child history.
It's a story that deals with the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> -- rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and in a chapter, and you put a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A little boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the variants of the connection between the magic, the Earth and technology has many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and by making augmented reality you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
At one point the screen is full of leaves the <unk>
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology can come to each other.
We have the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi. It's very simple.
It's got a doorknob on and <unk>
Every morning <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get 95 percent <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time in which he needs <unk> or an urgency of that style -- but she would look back.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than <unk> followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure for you to help patients, you could use it for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of your health.
From the next week to be available in the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are moving from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their own doctor, and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume an position, they come back to recover control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing handle costs and other issues.
It makes techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but it can also do with <unk>
And one of the things that we made to share with you with a video of you.
We all have checks navigation in the <unk>
Maybe we even have it on our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM ATMs in <unk>
Where are they all <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest to help this patient?
We asked, but no one would have a <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please make it <unk> where, sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 times, they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and to the next few weeks to use your <unk> cell to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in another universities, to help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody who is <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want companies to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They might be messaging services or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in place.
Please go ahead and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion in my drawing but it was a little bit different because using the camera the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography has more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction in a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common objective of keeping <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to seem to have been captured in some way as photography.
And so I think you're going to have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more than to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real?
Are the details or the <unk>
Do you hate light?
What is it that creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end it comes to our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in some ways can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's get into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It's actually to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture appears to be realistic -- I think they're those ones that don't even understand the things around our everyday life.
But by combining pictures it's very important, because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures combined should have the same kind of light.
And these two images are doing these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that you find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a spring of stone.
And yes, I even have a red guy at the top of the island, so it looks more <unk>
So to get an realistic result of it, I think it takes planning.
You start with a sketch, an idea.
Then we have to combine all the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful, and maybe quite a <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
If you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not so interested to show you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a scale of scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here something happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It makes more intensity because I write about paper.
Why do we have technology curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve in which, say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't tell you much.
But if you go back, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve -- it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation are as fast as <unk> last morning, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years by advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to do is -- look at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't follow forever.
You can't hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, "What is that new way to adopt the world?
What new state is driving the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember a kid that was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
And so I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that you <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back to a few and a half billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with many chemicals that would spread around them.
If we look at the way we organized those chemicals together, we give ourselves a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there were about oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplets held a particular combination of chemicals that they made to bring materials out of the outside and so they grew up grew up.
And they started split.
In a sense, those were the most respected cell shapes -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't living in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you have <unk> it <unk> a chemical distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every droplet was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better being better at the time of adding chemical chemicals to grow more, they grew more chemicals and more <unk>
Often they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple, but things are interesting -- interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution of meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two and two years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I try to hide to the security people at the airport.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we usually use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and is here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have it <unk> through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
So this made these cells happily have a billion years old.
But then another great step happened in which things got very different and was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form information forming so cells from cells.
I don't know if you know it, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found a way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate.
This communication gave up communities that, in a way, they were together in that way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community would become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities came up so much that they actually came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board board in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities, community communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is no longer the heart of the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and created more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make information more than process information in community.
These are the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities that they built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the structures that are responsible for <unk> to understand and transmit the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism, I could, for example, learning not to eat certain fruits because she knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been built these kinds of information processing structures that the evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
And so the fact that the nervous system built up those <unk> structures that was fundamentally the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now occur confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communications trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea of <unk>
I'm sitting here sitting here in doing <unk> and hopefully by building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take some very complicated thing to turn it into sound, in sound sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to do abstractions.
We now went through similar periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms, our medical methods show and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape <unk> the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the program <unk> in front of our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
And then we saw the language, and they took less than a million years.
And then we saw the electronics, like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this <unk>
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the global <unk>
But now design objects such as complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine <unk>
There are billions.
Instead, with <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you could not could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is the evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
So we say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million crime sequences.
You could run these instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those things that are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to figure out numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences for instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that do the <unk>
You get those and <unk> those and <unk>
And now we have the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and the children will break the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more successfully.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Let's try it again.
They were making some mutations in it.
And he tries to try and try and go again and go back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or, in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are just absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're very much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've been trying to figure out how they work.
These are very strange programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
I was walking on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make a good design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than what makes normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they were <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment of analog organisms when they became <unk>
We're <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant <unk> to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a lot of baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that I <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into a game without being <unk> and that anybody who will try to push it to the first base -- it doesn't get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know what you call a <unk> 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who 10 cars; <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player at the <unk> Heart League of <unk> in a regular rainy season.
Now I want this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they all combine to a surgeon who has also a record from 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a dear place has two coronary arteries and your family doctor bring it to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know something?
She's getting a lot of a little bit worse.
And its <unk> have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask:
What do you think of you should be the average of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a <unk> <unk>
Huh? <unk>
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I am involved with the Golden <unk>
Have you never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
Such that.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the nursing nursing home in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of the <unk> of every carotid artery that comes out of the <unk> mental diagnosis and the not standard.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of the school school with the impression that if you were born, then would know everything or more possible, close to everything else, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady into the emergency service where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to <unk>
And when the emergency room applies to a cardiologist to get me going into that patient.
And to report the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I did it, I heard a sound <unk> in both sides, which has a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read about.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
I sent it to his house without talking to the chief residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss had seen, you would have been able to give <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that will pay attention to me.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner man that said, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse who <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm good."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed the high and the ambulance next to the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, I had a bad deal with the stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I would have to leave the hospital and walked down to the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something I didn't normally do.
He went through the emergency room at home.
And there is another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors are.
Other specialists who fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: Does it remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of having come home, after I was left the high school, she suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I could just breathe and it was blue.
The emergency staff would take all their resources.
They gave up medication to raise the blood pressure.
They put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy, and expected against all hope it was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was apparent that you never <unk>
It had a permanent <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let me go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks later, I was overwhelmed by it and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, <unk> without feeling that shame because you can't afford them with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad at it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was so wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would get the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little <unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day, he opened up the sky and eventually came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself where if you were to get the efforts to be perfect to not make any errors, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It's going to happen.
Two years later, he was an assistant, in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man in his throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
He pointed out here.
I watched her throat, he was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent it to his house.
But as he went to the door he was following his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because it's an infection, but from the upper airline -- and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, not <unk>
You get antibiotics by <unk> and they recovered the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it's going to be used to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
So it was an X-ray X-ray but it turned out to be normal. A colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He made liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I would take it.
I did it and when you see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon <unk>
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I would love you <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show this to not make the same <unk>
If I had a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the errors in other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> that are making mistakes and <unk> who don't can sleep and the ones I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get rid of medicine to people who make mistakes, we'll get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism, I have done a personal personal study of a bad medical <unk> and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first paper that I wrote for the Toronto of "Star "Star <unk> Black art, white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are wrong, or the <unk> is not right -- in a system where infection <unk> are increasingly and more <unk> <unk> and death.
In this country, they die 5,000 Canadian Canadian <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is activated every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes from <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with alcohol and suddenly my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get into it, and we eliminate all the professionals that are likely to be wrong, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> white art, <unk> art, it's a habit of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah. "What are your <unk> And I would bring the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The redefined physician is human, you know human, they accept it, and not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
Do the mistakes of other people do not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everybody to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes once in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, let's make mistakes.
And I feel so much about it, but I'm a good time to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that he says to pick up an American American, are about 70 a day.
Not a lot ago in a research followed by a week to a group of business companies.
The researchers recorded different tasks for these executives and time that they were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included many, many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of a <unk>
How is the way that we run those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the <unk> of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of day, are you ready to hear the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this at the very, very small supermarket at least in that little era was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard <unk> and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water. And this was when we were taking water from <unk>
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked myself, why did I never buy anything?
This is a shelf oil shelf floor.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> <unk> coming from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "Get this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed up the buses full of tourists who came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk> hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
We put a post to <unk> right to the entrance to the store.
We put out six <unk> or 24 flavors of different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what if people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a quarter that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
From the ones to stop when there were only three percent of them came to buy <unk>
Where they stood up when there was six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were found six, that if they were found 24.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably get <unk> -- less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the car <unk> makes us very well <unk>
We decided to don't decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about savings for the retirement of a million Americans in this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funds are available in savings plans.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
And we found that the bigger the number of funds were <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that there are about 60 funds, the rate of participation dropped to the 50th 1960s.
It turns out, even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those that they decided to participate, the higher the number of choices, more people will be allowed to avoid actions or investment.
The more there would be more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial security.
But none of these extreme decisions are what we are striving to to optimize climate financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative implications by giving them more and more possibilities.
Most likely is that we make the decisions even when it goes on against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less than <unk> even though objectively they get better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and pick up that amazing <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we've collected in one form or another, in different research, so you can test in their businesses.
The first one is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People always get upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of strange options, there will be a <unk> increase in sales, there's a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation eliminated the products for junk cats that are less <unk> become <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and less costs.
You know that the supermarkets supermarkets today are 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, it's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it provides only <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the best options is the cause of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a life fund of life.
Those who really want to choose a choice, they are not 300 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they won't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people of this audience to have a vacation of all paid to the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a applause if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay, so anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second <unk> but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the issue of the car <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each other, and that the consequences must feel very much very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses cards or debit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it looked more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive than people are going to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> staff who were working on <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we did exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that you would love the personal thing you would think about the positive things that you would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than we can manage to.
For example, this is a study that we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in the rainy season, we saw the length of the <unk> the show of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to do it.
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think that the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This framework is totally useless.
The categories need to indicate something that we don't have to do -- not when they <unk>
And you often see this problem with these giant funds.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase economic complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German car maker.
You have to take a little bit of a <unk> to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices each one.
It has 56 possibilities.
<unk> box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, in a few days -- four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a choice, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to do?"
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> always the default button <unk> it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to days, we would have the default button over and over again, and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from few choices to many, many they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where the information is presented.
If we start the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice is not saying anything about the preferences of inner decoration.
We're very excited about a product that we're building now has more engaged in the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can make a handle on more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful if we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that I had to put in front of the government.
I had to register a text sheet, written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a writing with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West -- we don't think that somebody could do this, how much it would do -- freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and printing a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow printed dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes you and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot of a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> city in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> money on their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their fortunes online but they do it by illegal media by providing to steal money from our accounts when they buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a computer computer.
The secret services of the United States was two months ago, <unk> the <unk> of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be any of us are a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from wrong with worse.
In the future, most of those crimes happen online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate them, the opinions, they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group is the national governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack, against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authoritative authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall fall because of a <unk>
They put the safety of the site and carried a <unk>
Last week, I asked in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government asked one of the leaders if you were to say, <unk> death of people who cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except for a foreign authority to the foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters in the headquarters for Egyptian police in April, 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that manila folder, there were notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a big scale of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 500,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company based is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for the governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
The Internet connection to the Internet.
We have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think close to things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I have nothing to do that.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play with privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's freedom against control.
If we could be able to trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, will be forever.
I'm going to be blind in any future government, in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Side of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and the back of the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park National Park has no fences in most of the south, which means that wild animals like the <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning, and we found him dead so bad because it was the only bull <unk>
My community, the <unk> we think we came from from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
People were dying that they protect our community and their livestock and they are also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing I was going to happen to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would be afraid.
But I realized that actually I didn't know because I even helped the lions see the pen a step away.
I don't think <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick male lions so they believed it was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came up with the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So it jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day male lions came from.
I found that male lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell picks up the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how lions see it, when they come at night.
The lights were <unk> and they <unk> male lions so that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses you heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that were lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
<unk> you can see in the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving very much.
And my idea is used now for all Kenya, to frightening to other predators like <unk> <unk> and also being used for <unk> <unk>
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
And I even took my friends to my community and we set up the lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to fix them.
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the closet of the savanna <unk> my father, and he used to see airplanes.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer from aviation and pilot when you started.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving my father from my dad and lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do something close to CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented skeletal <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So you would take it a time, right, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We are going to <unk> in every step that <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except the Americas, the South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was asking myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until all changed in a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague of mine.
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five member of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last few weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I was walking in front of the train, station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child lying in his arms watching her face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
Very, huge famine in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more <unk> the <unk> of energy, all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to go across <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I would see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugee
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North refugees in China were regarded as illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> me in the police.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I opened my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at asylum in <unk>
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Though there were eventually been released after a lasts international pressure lasts eventually ...
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, South Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape, a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and to find work, everybody can get it in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to take a risk by going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or a <unk>
Where am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call <unk>
Even though I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the exam at college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities in North Korea had a little bit of money sent to my family, and as blame my family was going to be shifted to force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run immediately away.
So I started planning how I started to escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, in South Korea, for the edge.
So, ironically, I took an flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to get it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was coming up with the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM -- and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and another two North Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I sat down with all my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to be able to get it more <unk>
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and support of the international community are really the lightning ray that the people would need to do.
Over time, after our journey, my family and I came together in South Korea, for the time.
But achieving their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family contact, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive in international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, fast land.
So the city planners get together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Central Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles South, as if this is going to be what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> fast <unk> land.
Like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert food, Los Angeles Center home for places of food to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about is that the places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying from <unk> diseases in Los Angeles South <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I was trying to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see lawn <unk> and sold as cars <unk>
I see <unk> centers like Starbucks <unk>
And I think this must be stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and forth to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This was how I decided to keep it right.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and started to plant our forest of food, <unk> trees -- you know, nine full vegetables already know.
What we do, we're kind of paid paid <unk> made out of gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody got <unk>
The city sat on top of it, and the city was given to me by saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I was like, "Come on.
A <unk> law enforcement in a piece of land that no one was <unk>  And so he was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had a written story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> was a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
<unk> is the city of America with more <unk> land.
It's 68 miles of land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> billion plants.
Why the hell don't you look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
Put your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Asia.
I grew up there. Tell my children there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Just like an artist of <unk> who <unk> walls, and I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, it's my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became a tool of education, in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one occasion, which came a mother and her daughter, were like the night <unk> and they were in my garden, and they were looking at me and looked very <unk>
I, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was so close to my hunger, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh God no, I'm not afraid you're going to go <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the same time, I want you to hold your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, and they work and put them all on volunteer.
If the kids are growing up, the guys will eat <unk>
If none of this will grow up, they will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you're not taught how food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind what they put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see the color boys who are on this path that is designed for them, that doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys who were being supported from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to get shipping and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I don't know.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people working on the streets of the street, who know the joy, the pride and pride and honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Does the <unk> take your <unk>
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you're not called me if you want to sit on the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some of shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  <unk> <unk> --  -- probably everybody agrees with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains very much.
You can have a lot of water on asphalt to asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you're going <unk> on your bicycle and these cars go -- that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a silent road.
The solution to that is to make road road roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so the entire rain water flow over the sides and will have a road that is easy to drive, and they wouldn't get water out of it.
Noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise -- so it's a very silent road.
It also has a <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones on the surface of the surface went out.
So first a stone, then several more and more, and so on, and then then ... " I won't do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how damage appears in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if they were <unk> they're going to become <unk> and being separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the wool of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of wool wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you are using a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat down, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will spread back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take you out to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we made a piece of road, 400 feet away from the <unk> highway, where we had to do a lane lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, we put them up with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers bringing together these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the surface. They actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curious about whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool the first before I can show you how the repair is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC News on his little gray radio.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban were <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were charged with Afghanistan and they were illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I gave myself a little boy to get my older sister to my older sister who no longer could be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were two could be able to do.
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could be suspicious where they were going.
We had to hide the books on market bags so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally in school suddenly a week, a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they know of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is.
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It was left for two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that her children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not raising their children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was too frustrated about our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. You can get them to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you still want to do not <unk>
I am 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who drove him on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global annual ambassador to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friends, <unk> for them, even though they even face a <unk> opposition.
Like <unk> It's not the true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> out of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to his house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> now, if he <unk> he said, "but I will not harm the future of my old daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I have noticed of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the <unk> there's a parent who recognized the value of his daughter and that sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, it's often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the one of Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school -- remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
And so it turns out that these changes didn't last much, after the retirement of U.S. troops from U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that I see them, I see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day <unk> <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution broke by mass <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> within and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the decline of the regime, they were billboards for freedom, and social justice.
You've shown a copy of <unk> the brutal dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses from about 50 thousand dead, we managed to liberate our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a transition and just a transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation, national reconciliation,
About 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I began to organize the developing development and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> for <unk> a movement of women, leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of selfish policies and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution like a whole, were <unk> every day.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of murder of American ambassador, and the attack of <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army <unk>
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and its human rights violations.
Our society, made up for a <unk> mindset, which has become more, and it's been away from the early ideals and early of freedom, dignity, social justice.
The <unk> <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us today with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to tell us that we, as a nation, choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't get peace, stability and security.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by political policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus than the election, which is only the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the feminine <unk> the most important representation of representation and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents and call them days of anger.
We need to start acting as law enforcement and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also putting it into practice, <unk> instead of <unk> that collaboration instead of engaging the competition instead of inclusion rather than exclusion.
These are the ideals that an Libya, barbaric war for war, desperately desperately <unk> in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that it is about the interconnection and <unk> between women's and male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known to be known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> and <unk> that spans the humanity of the men and women, that all the tribes and all of the peoples have <unk>
And so, like the uterus completely cover the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix.
This is what he said, "My <unk> <unk> all the stuff."
He said, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That everybody is telling them the <unk> of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a scary question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody does. Why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who would tell him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not a domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, my head <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anybody in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from <unk> <unk> <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I have almost 20 years to married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> relationships and <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place you want or we expect or we would expect to find <unk> for which, the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who would stick with a man who would stick it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women of the age of 16 and 24 years old, have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women are killed every year by partners, <unk> and teenage men in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the New York subway and started <unk> me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and that worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
I had a few big <unk> like apples, and one hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that I did in the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning, <unk>
We started out and loved everything of me, that I was so ready that I had been to Harvard, I had put a passion in helping girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was so that the president of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together to Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head in a physical trap and financial <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts with it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to be able to feel so safe and bought three <unk>
One was the <unk> of the car.
Another thing he kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those <unk> guns who had the trauma that he lived from a child.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never spent my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute every day.
The first physical attack in <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we would live happy forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted me so much.
And he was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> by the wedding and by the fact that they form a family with me.
He had been a isolated accident and I never would make harm.
I spent twice on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> me, and he gave me so strong in my head that we were writing several times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey, he went through traffic and threw me up a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> continued to get one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a really good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man in the world, and it was the only person in the world who could help meet their <unk>
The other question everybody does is: Why don't you just <unk>
Why wouldn't I tell me, I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because we victims, victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is killed.
More than 70 percent of the youth killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include the permanent prostitution, even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family justice system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend long time without the man who supports their mother.
And yet we continue to ask why it's just not going out?
I was able to figure out because of a last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed if she had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone -- the police, the police, my neighbors and my friends and family friends -- and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims of the victims of <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally get <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that they will understand their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely lives of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I got married with a <unk> and kind of nice man and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to ever have more, ever is a <unk> pistol like my head in the hands of somebody who says that he wants.
Right now, they are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you, there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> and they're <unk> themselves.
The <unk> might be affecting their daughter, their sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love of particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Natural abuse just in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
We need the victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the light talking about it with your kids, his coworkers and family and family.
It will take their vision for survivors as fantastic and fantastic people who have a future <unk>
You know, <unk> the actual signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to stop its climb and show the victims of a safe way.
And together we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis safe and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed you like this.  Luckily, I brought him clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of good luck in this way, I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to go ahead and do it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about it in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These lips are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater on the head, because it's when they're going to make fun of me, so I don't do anything while it covers me.
All right.
Why did I do that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I'd never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me to go back and forth the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there's very little to be able to do to transform our looks, which, while shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm model, I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my workplace -- that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> I was <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're asking what is this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape to <unk> and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known as to take money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing up, and maybe some of them are <unk> that <unk> <unk> -- there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> of knowing both models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York I told each and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- that is less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Could it be model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know about it.
But then what I would really tell you about each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or an artificial <unk> surgeon and poet, which would be <unk> because you were the first.
If after this list, I still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, then I would say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> of the American <unk> magazine, or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's outside your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a copy of your backs, no matter what you're going to do, you know, if you pretend you want to be president of the United States, but you might be weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know that we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and at <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, including <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and they would never use, except the <unk> but the privilege that I get is the I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- I don't think of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price on their heads no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from <unk> teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk> And so on.
When we research for this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes down to 78 percent at 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you expect to be, if you're a little thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing being able to work with creative and clever people.
And that's all the way, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about it every day.
And if you ever get wondering, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group group, because they have the most bright legs -- the brighter hair and the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough enough to hold into a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 little pictures -- and I didn't go on the line.
There were no directors, directors, <unk> no chance to repeat the photos, not even a low care toll on light.
In fact, most of them took them taken random tourists.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife brought me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to go back to New York right one year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said, "Why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists which would happen to be <unk>
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop time in one week in October and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we expect to be illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when you suddenly stop in my tracks and pointed out of a red <unk> of the pirate pot shop that <unk> little on the previous <unk>
And he described to me that there was meaning to the five years in that same place.
<unk> that remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively engaging in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I didn't go out in many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I didn't get to go on and get up to someone and asked him to get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most unequal birds.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, as a <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press press, laughter, laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it.
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean, the environment.  The <unk> are not helping to prevent disease from diseases.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far away from <unk>  And my favorite, <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World World, where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important -- first of all, providing ecological services that provide vital ecological services.
It's our <unk> <unk>
They put the cadavers into the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria that they help to absorb the anthrax than they would not be because they would stretch and cause huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and under Egypt.
In the <unk> Indian <unk> I was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil from 10 shrunken heads.
In <unk> culture, it's made a few very important <unk> <unk> in places like <unk> there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural <unk> system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight <unk> species in Kenya, which six are on the extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities are using this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey from the <unk> of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned from using veterinarian in India and they've taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb, and the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up to the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible death of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the stock market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel for different countries, so to focus on a working problem is not going to serve it.
We need to work with governments at <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you walk out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed because he saw them fly without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- I <unk> my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya of <unk> Kenya, and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that I would do is <unk>
Our first project, which I inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we get to seed <unk> the south of Zambia to this utterly magnificent valley that descends down into the river <unk> and we teach the local to grow Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not interested in doing that, so what they were trying to come to come to work, and sometimes they didn't survive.  We were amazed that the local in that valley, in that valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not <unk> we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  <unk> time to save the people from Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew up.
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a ship would grow up to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night at the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say?
I thought we just would make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans do, what they were doing, what they were doing and then saw what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>   -- to see the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It was part of an African woman -- the damage we've done.
Westerners are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my kids were going to be a lot."
I mean, I try all of the different culture of a different culture like my <unk>
That's why whites in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in my face, "The small is <unk> written by <unk> who said for economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at the age of age to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you have never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and sit with people from <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee cafe. We met at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, but not at <unk> meetings.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
entrepreneurs never <unk> and they're never going to tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest person in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't watch their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family of the company, the family physician in the company, who sets up with you at your house, at the table in your kitchen table, and it helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Europe.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage where we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I <unk> and <unk>   So the government says, "Let's go again."  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most successful business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they got involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now they <unk> reconstructing <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these people together come to talk to you.
You have to offer you for a <unk> it has to be fantastic to help and then make it come to mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and <unk>
What are you going to show you more this tomorrow?
Local <unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossils will not renewable <unk> <unk> and from one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to support <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> he gathered together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is still growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already tested in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would be <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> generic manufacturers -- <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days ago, <unk> factories in a <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise you're not going to talk to you with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell a fantastic financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, and sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and observed and observed to the 100 companies of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, just one: None of them was started by one person.
I didn't know the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars and in bars and who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> somebody who speaks about this <unk> somebody who speaks to you, "What needs them?
What can you do you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> who seeks <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, why don't we spend a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much paid my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrowing more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes to the cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which gives shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city in a city.
And there is a <unk> to the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most <unk> <unk> properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a better space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
his death was sudden and that was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And it produced a profound gratitude for the lived time and for the time of life.
He gave it clarity to the significant stuff of my current life.
But let me try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends, transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board and painted about her sentences for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to do about this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk>   "Before I die I want to die on the line of <unk> change.
"Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I died, I want to get more time longer."
"Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
"Before I die I want to be completely myself."
So this abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving the reflection and <unk> and remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have been made over countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give ourselves the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in our era, it's more important than ever before, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
<unk> is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that to prepare for death is one of those things that would be more power.
Think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than we care about individuals and as community and more media to share fears and stories, the people around us, cannot help us improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
Don't talk about, but it raises better joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares what it will happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell the words that I can't even see -- I could even say one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years. It's very <unk>
You get the most precious memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me the year when I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, to get her pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing that was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that we're going to be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders in the development that faster in the world, no cause no cure for it.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I was a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it came back more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and the urban <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who would see the world without <unk> a human being.
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, times when they wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things I would not want to change as normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could get a single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would say, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that we eat. It's a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside of it, and frankly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change die at the time when we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a communications teacher that gave a communications class to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> of these students with their great minds with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But in the way those conversations, I felt what was going to have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
<unk> I felt when I had these conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open up that door is a big communication.
We need desperately a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenge, from energy to environment and health care and health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of his ideas.
Sure, they can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them silly
Instead, as Einstein, said, which everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They're ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
So you have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do <unk> bullets and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but that's too supported in the language area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a bit, and then provide a graphics that will inform our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding than they were <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the rest of the other we open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all the media, we have to go with it.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the English English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor at the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge -- no matter <unk> or start, and that when he wins, gets it through the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
They put him in the London Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and in the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's a literal way.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, the leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
You were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of the world to get married, because this debate went through for three weeks.
He read a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King if he did not want him to do it or his assistant, ideas.
So they wanted to give him the most <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President's invented the title. There was before, but it just meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign the treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title and <unk> and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite up to where I've ever seen, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to go there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we may be able to move for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy in the world and a fleet of autonomous air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, <unk> the appearance of the Senate, -- well, it was an <unk> then.
But do you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when I tell you that now it's the president of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really changing the words a lot more the words than they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to a meter underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of celestial bodies in the dark, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, this cacophony of male <unk> and rocks and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap firefly <unk> attached to the head with this elastic <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of the branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter which falls 100 meters on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days earlier, who lost control and dropped <unk> meters on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole at the risk of taking their lives without paid and reward and, often, dying.
I went home and went home but they may never will, because they're prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a nonprofit that was dedicated to modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not like grade.
When we finished talking about, I was really sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
And he made me feel the stomach and a weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
A few of them, in fact, considered my second home.
But this time, we would take the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there is more than 27 million people in the world.
It is twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 of them today.
However, today you can enslaving entire families from entire generations of retirement debt, from 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with fake good and better and better job to find that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating in <unk> the <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce these are disposable them.
Now, slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This weird show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature <unk> temperature -- men, women, kids, in fact, entire families were born in a heavy cloak of <unk> stack of <unk> bricks in their heads, and they take them from the blast <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee without eating, and to eat, and the severe <unk> made it quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work with air conditioning and sitting there, and I was thinking, my camera receives a lot better than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't the citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and he trusted that he was <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> rocks for miles through <unk> <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children than their charge and the children would put them on their heads with straps <unk> and ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something that <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> his freedom, the <unk> burned all their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness -- I would argue that it would be difficult for me to work with safety in this particular business.
In <unk> I was told, women were previously previously been previously <unk>
I was led to a few wheels that gave this dirty basement <unk> faint <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as it is called the craft, they are local prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to pursue customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every wearing is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember having sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I only had a <unk> on the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows out of big enough windows to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we touch a topic that is so hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that we often associate with <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in which there were entire families in the heart of silk.
This is a family.
Black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
You still hope, however, you can get out of this house one day and go to another place where we actually pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> lake the world's largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishing family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger children, make sense of it?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing how to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat was approached by the subject that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The branches of the branches of trees immersed in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, it's thrown into water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the youngest slaves under its command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they had the latest networks, but they had been working from the one one of the time.
<unk> on the cold night, <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the <unk>
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
He ran through a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
It was asked to do it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver that came out quickly.
Then he pointed up this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the path.
As we started to -- we took off the <unk> that we put on the road and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of migrant workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters of <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are embedded in a well in the other part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweating.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 300 feet and these people carry heavy bags of rock bags that then they will be attached to another area where they would take the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at the closer side, we see the other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When she died his uncle, he was making it the debt of uncle who force it to be slave in mines.
When I met him, he had been working in the mines 14 and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work on night and day on that mine.
Yet, he was released with being released and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, the <unk> of the face of a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that his images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted to know that we will take testimony to them and we're going to do everything in order to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not about magazines. It's from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights and dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people who have the great honor of thinking about.
I hope that these images show a force in the people you see in people like you, and I hope that that force turns up a fire and that fire will shine light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do this mathematical math -- and there's a particular problem for whom we are <unk> we are like management agencies.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
So dance is one of the most human activities.
We were telling us the <unk> of the ballet and the <unk> dancers -- that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demands a degree of training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain initial landscape that can be a genetic techniques.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease destroyed gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a very ballet dancer <unk>
Over the last few years has moved on in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we're going to know if there's actually a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, and so they don't use blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never get done. It's never been done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test themselves?
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is -- as a way that I have no conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds like this, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal messages, because we need to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes that we have for example.
And as the <unk> requires a kind of extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn how to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as we come in, and as well as Parkinson's disease affects the limbs it also affects the <unk> organs.
You can see a <unk> example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they are both <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> Both of you use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are accurate, but also the tests based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They're very quickly, they take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something takes such a <unk> cost there's massive scale.
These are some incredible skills to address.
We can reduce the patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the top of routine.
With high frequency we could get goals.
We could do a massive low-cost rate for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and to start addressing these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or no disease, can call it low price and leave recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we already have had six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people will be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or no disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not know it.
But we're going to get a very, very large sample of data from different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances it's important because we're looking for <unk> the factors factors for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a accuracy accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> have done a fantastic job and now it has shown that it works in mobile phone network as well, what we put on the project, we now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. <unk> <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We lie in the dark, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin still more perfect -- we can actually make it possible and <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste by images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events were happening in Japan.
Soon a long time later, an organization where I was <unk> -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small fishing village located in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of water used over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
We take over the channels and <unk>
We took schools. We took the slime away, and we left ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of dead fish and tons of dead fish.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around the people around the world.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal loss that people had <unk>
As they came out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a city of <unk> town.
It helped to clean up the compost toilets, the huge gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center of the <unk>
And I had the honor and I had the honor for that day to be <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going through my horizons that something happened.
And by looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
He wasn't too <unk> but where water had <unk> the face of the girl -- I had to get a lot of precision and <unk>
Anyway, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they came by sort of the more pictures and they needed more <unk> so I walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we're going to become <unk> a street town north of <unk>
Once we had a week using our scanner in the libraries of libraries that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time I think about <unk> is a different story, depended on course from the <unk>
It could be an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much by hand using the areas whose areas and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos <unk> in saltwater, covered in bacteria, and even <unk> even oil, along with the step of time, I continue to <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean up, dry and had been <unk> by her <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have the guide of a neighboring <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more of the photos that are already <unk>
As he once said -- the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were actually lucky to the photos.
He had started <unk> herself but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face wouldn't have been able to get married, we were able to put pictures in a single picture and put it up the whole picture.
When I picked up his pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos in a firemen station between the rubble of where he used to be his house, but their colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her pictures his son at least was a 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could do -- something that he could come back to look at, something that could remember from the past that would not have been marked by the day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
And after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority of them went to their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 families hundreds of photos were totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing we would look for.
And this was what the project was to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone out their connection to the past.
When a picture like this, you give someone, this is a huge difference in the life of the person who get there.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something larger to bring something, using its talent for something that is not a perfect heart of perfect skin.
To finish I'd like to read this email and I emailed it the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was born, I couldn't stop thinking about people and all the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, I was gathering because a picture like my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, I and my daughter just <unk> <unk>
In the whole world, in all the few times our basic needs are <unk> right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that comes through an apple in an exhibit of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create videos in motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it down and put it on a <unk> <unk> or a number of <unk> to create a bunch of photons only one millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet that bullet and this package of photons and reappear on this bottle, how do you disperse those photons photons into this <unk>
What is the word of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   -- remember, all this is actually in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light up.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't take this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes into the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in a variety of directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that bounces out inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the bits were <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it at slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film, from a slow bullet in motion.
And how about proving nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the waves out of the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes can see a <unk>
But if you look once more and more of this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light <unk> <unk> it keeps <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces out inside its inside and get it back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they are going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, photographers, -- you know, if we take a picture at the low exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest show, so I'll just get into some light.
<unk> that <unk> that set of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very tight <unk> we took these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude data and sort of an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future would be able to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. I'm going to go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the chamber but interestingly, in times slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique capabilities alone.
It's got very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point corresponds to what a distance.
So when you project a laser -- you can record a picture in numbers, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we are going to go and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction now.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that have <unk> collisions with what's going on the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see inside of the body by having <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood -- this is pretty difficult, so actually this is a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new set of visualizing to solve the problems of equivalent to the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, it turned science in art, an art of photographs of photography.
I realized that all of the data data we collected every time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see it.
To create a new form of a computer model of <unk> and <unk>
And look those ripples Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But there is also something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you're going to get away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events occur in the world is often shown by the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and gives you freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can get it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
And here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are striving for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they would take a change, and they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
Who have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your cell phones out.
<unk> One Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot, almost all of you have a cell phone.
But today I'm talking about my mobile, and how life changed.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 percent lines of information.
<unk> data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> de <unk>
This tells you that every board says that every single mobile telephone company has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who's sent a text to who.
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or your Internet supplier.
And all of Europe stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone <unk> and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, <unk> priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the Berlin streets and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be, 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany, <unk>
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please get me through my entire information who had about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to ask for them, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the day, they would have an agreement.
<unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of fruit in the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At first I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a while I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So next to <unk> <unk> and open City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see that you can see how I'm going to be on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what time you can sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who sends an email to who, this is all possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known to who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When you go home tell their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, and it's not gone past fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative mainly because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, which information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we spend all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, even though they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you to come in there.
It's wrong for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> Christmas are at the shopping center, drive on circles on search and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they're thinking, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am Palestinian -- Muslim woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial version.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in your "Don't face.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three big sisters would be <unk> I was <unk>
If my three sisters older were going to public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I was also out and if we didn't take all the top note -- all the <unk> the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach I used to do was hang a dollar in front of me so that you would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a boxer champion who's gotten a lot of taps.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and remain all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to <unk> the <unk> like <unk>
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> hunger for <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three full months without eating, so <unk> at the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy -- so I sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to be used to <unk> me too.
And when my friends went to spend the summer vacation on the coast of <unk> I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to stay in <unk>
In the summer holiday often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> to get me pink cups back into the back, I was blown down into the Sea <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can rotate it in your head.
My parents came up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the <unk> University of the state of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, pulled the ultimate note in my classes and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow into Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> When I finally got a <unk>
I've got <unk>
At the end of the end, I finally went back.
Thank God <unk> at the end I'm a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater department crying crying as if someone had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because she thought he could not do the stunts
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts -- you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper for which he was literally born and was given to an actor.
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors who have disabled papers.
And I went back home, and my first tour tour was just as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see more than <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> directors not <unk> <unk> <unk> with disabilities.
It just empowers perfect people.
But there were exceptions to rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took comics from New York to New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he landed on the realization that he was at high-speed by the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little disgusting rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and at the time you remind the <unk> principals that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was a little bit like invited to the cable news program with Keith <unk>
I walked out to a graduate dance, I joined a study and sat down in a <unk> wheelchair.
I looked at the head and I said, "Excuse me, "Can me give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held on the desk for the host to not go through the screen through the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like I was at a full-time participant and hit my chair.
Something that I learned in <unk> with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or a little girl or older people.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I read clips online with comments like, "Why did I <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> terrorist.
What does the disease have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- yeah, <unk> man.
We are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that they don't understand, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, but I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, I would have fewer hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My missionary journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of soap <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I became a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of New Jersey state in New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded "The children of <unk> a charity to give children Palestinians -- a tiniest tiniest tiniest little bit of what my parents would love me.
It was the only time my father saw me work alive, and I do this talk to her memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young village of a young village.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town of <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives a small village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no future perspectives.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day I read a man who offers him to take him back to dinner after dinner, and he was <unk>
Tell a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes and buy new clothes to send your family.
There is a young guy.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It's got a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car sky.
That child in that little town with the great city of the large city was the <unk> terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small village of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that got it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated on urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> unemployed urban <unk> who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, for work, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work, not go to school.
They do not do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few youth leaders on a business peak.
They went to about 90 African-American leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate college student, I was frustrated, I was a perfect white white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle for point A to point B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the street system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to get it.
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> invited to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What do you do to this different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think <unk> spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so effective.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was invited to train some of the young people at the pinnacle of corporate initiative and how to create a culture of business initiative culture.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed had flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from the <unk>
If you gave somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he began to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people can go together, and like he says, "We smell pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't <unk> pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, and to work for the government, but their story, which is really a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be entrepreneurs, that might be a <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
It will provide business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit -- it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas true.
They need expertise and guidance in development and put in their businesses.
It empowers young people to the resources that they need to do -- they need the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and they will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
And the <unk> of the <unk> that's how it calls it when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their innovation -- and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we could almost find that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed had a <unk> of about four square feet, with apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question kept with me, and they would get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> our garbage, which is <unk> by 11 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable product every day.
I wanted to figure out as individuals.
I wanted to understand who he does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities throughout the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in trucks. I was <unk>
And <unk> mechanical <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one is going to become fast.
It costs a lot of getting to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies continued to protect the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and <unk> all around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker now.
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often get off the truck and cause terrible damage to it.
I also learned about how <unk> of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
I think the stigma is particularly ironic because I think <unk> that waste <unk> are the most important workforce on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective form of each day, this starts to get rid of its containers and its dangers inherent in real ways are becoming very real ways.
Something that we had <unk> for decades and centuries come back to <unk> and they start <unk>
The economics needs it.
If we can't get rid of that old we don't have room for what the economics of the economy begin to fail when they're endangered percent.
I'm not advocating of capitalism, but I just put their relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed of everyday need.
So I mean just how much speed of us used to move in contemporary <unk>
We're not usually <unk> or <unk> or we are doing with us our cup of coffee, our bag of water -- our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that is to take about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when it <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from ourselves, our own <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his job that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started to research collection collection and came back to that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include in account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The municipal waste we think about when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, take a moment to <unk>
I was a moment to tell you so much.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center for several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as example, to my team and me, what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are a lot in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat inside, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, what it looks like has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile place for a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure in the air that thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a building, of a number of stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries from the building.
And this extends out of a inclined <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that would spread from its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that empowers the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric <unk> with <unk> <unk> to allow the air input and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of dresses of <unk>
They have properties of the fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals crystals that use the interior light of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas that it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what they <unk>
But at all, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because in order to the commercial center, there were more local to sell.
And in addition to the idea of the facade -- much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to glass, but it was also because they had no air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city where the electricity takes almost every day.
So we get a huge advantage putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water from the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth ground floor.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project that's so big, the bigger that I have designed, I needed to not just understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its environment, and the culture.
During that analysis, I found a little bit of attention in <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 access gates with almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets and creating 12 similar blocks into size and features to the ones that are in Barcelona and other cities from Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points in relation to the idea of interacting doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation, was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's build a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a higher density at higher levels and lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and go up and make things like run a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach in design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes local communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had great hair lots of hair, and a little <unk> of pencils and <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of the real <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was just a time after the school out of the school. It was a little late late to the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took the table of grades.
And then, I did.
I put the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some like this.
All the same --  And I organized my book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them in <unk> and I was a row out of this, just by being there, because I am."
I still wonder what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I was well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I will never be surprised.
But most of all, I gave myself the reason why I bothered this little girl so small, was so good for <unk>
I joined jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses rates in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that observe the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which they study <unk> in all of its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be literature.
Well, it wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
I wouldn't have King <unk> not <unk> <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I took off the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost all of them.
This year is now 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> -- and thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their wish, are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being at the time storytellers and audience, we know exactly what a little bit of the details of the knife is, right?
The <unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood understand.
All that she makes for me pleasure could give pleasure to the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that she detects in his lover, he adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are we <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great piles of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
It's so that Instagram that Instagram is so successful --  <unk> the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in your <unk> agony of soon listening to the doors of the doors and <unk> the <unk> -- so it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search of knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the pathways that were <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to make us suffer, it causes us to be a lot more profound and more profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can tell us.
It's saying we're going to go and look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion we would tell us, our horrible ambition and our <unk> ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion teaches us to look so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud had been visited by a very <unk> young young man who was being used with the idea that his woman was going to get it.
And Freud said there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing <unk>
<unk> <unk> or accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of your wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> make us look with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are we are, more we became ethical residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal acts of acts for it.
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight years old, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of Michigan was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since he would be sent messages and <unk> itself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to awe.
Because let's be realistic.
What big, although <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very weird and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> <unk> books that deal with our minds <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want you to <unk> your own being and <unk> what you ever <unk> and he's under the floor -- it takes your <unk> blood accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live on jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse by Professor <unk> that criminal genius ...
But I've always had a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius -- but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we do it and do it with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the times we see <unk> he was in the story, and I think this is very emotional. That's mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relationship with another?
Well, maybe we don't have to take it from the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like plans for <unk>
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
It just fiction, jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what they <unk> sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo module of Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on gray gray is the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization. In American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
People died of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo <unk> program 24 traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which lies with Armstrong after Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But at the University of Rice at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do we <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might also ask, why scale the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of <unk> technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles a hour.
Since 1970, no human being has returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than <unk> 10, and the optimism joyful about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve like going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't take the escape tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was totally sure I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's where it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks as if the technologists would have <unk> us and have enriched with trivial, which are things like <unk> or social networks, or algorithms that speed up selling it <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created by the less ambitious companies that were <unk> from the years to be <unk> I was <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment that caused the creation of ideas to be created by the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without caring for the risk, they preferred small investment that they could leave in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term in the long term, not have invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have any immediate value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we go to <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from energy from renewables like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is extremely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and foreign treaties are going to develop the development of sustainable energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control rate of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America, or the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, they are not to be.
We know for long time that famines are a result of failure on food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops like crops or systems for storage and food systems, but there will be famines as there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
The <unk> president declared the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and organisms, but these four elements have <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, institutions must support the <unk> it should be really about a problem <unk> and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy -- which is hard and dangerous, and there's no popular fiction fiction mythology like exploring the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon, it turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline in trust, and it's a very generalized belief, in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been bad <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task that I think gives you a better idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that may have dropped in some activities or institutions and that might have risen in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no amount of evidence.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, are still quite <unk> their nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost just halfway through.
But that's enough?
What <unk> opinion are, of course, opinion.
What else can you get?
What you see is generic attitudes that people manifests themselves when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
You probably ask for asking, "What do you do for?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some other no."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place trust <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence level that we're going to feel by a kind of determined guy, <unk> or type, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I would say I trust an elementary teacher I know I know to give the class of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think these surveys are really bad tools to measure the real confidence level of real trust, because they're trying to do the good judgment of an inherent judgment in something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
And frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not the goal that I <unk>
I want to get more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
So ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were taking their savings with the very rightly called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
To more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is it about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that one person is competent in the <unk> <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yes, on the contrary, they're not responsible for you not to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but I don't get them to get them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do, to do before we trust.
Trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that made us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, <unk> the problem is it takes longer to do the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we would argue that the accountability system that is destined to ensure the <unk> and testing tests are actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably all know similar examples.
We would have all that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you think about it being worthy of trust and <unk> people that are reliable and whether or whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- the <unk> which is not done properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if you're two people, together, trying to improve the trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's <unk> because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the base blocks enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually as large, all the time.
But you also have to give you some evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes a day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where my socks shop is said that I can go around them without giving any explanations for.
I take them and get it back to me and get the money back to me from the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you come back vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not really hard to <unk>
In what people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early early computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital data, the separation between our material and the world on the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how it would be.
I first created this tool that was focused on digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can make their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool that the barriers.
But both of them remain still outside the screen.
How will you get inside and interact with digital information using the <unk> <unk>
In the Science of Science -- from Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
It <unk> a transparent <unk> cameras to detect your fingers and your face, you can now lift the keyboard, you get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that there are on the bottom of every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we are feeding in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We had a lot of us would have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea more far, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them a lot of physical way that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this one <unk>
This magnet <unk> behaves like a pixel in 3D in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this three-dimensional space.
And we did what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> and mechanical <unk>
And to digitally programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically <unk> and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality, the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real experience and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital data is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without having to be <unk> in our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that stays our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was only a direct way to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
Whatever I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer Chinese India.
This was me, on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
And so I wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was already too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness would only be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me, wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of Nan <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told you, "It's so different, and much better than it <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this kind of <unk> guilt trap.
I find this with a new culture also led to my <unk> <unk>
Let's make a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in real life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
You can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> <unk> are economic and politics and <unk>
To Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> ["The <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of missing in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother." <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling or powerless ...
Have a dream of <unk> that's really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a dream <unk> can do that for you.
And that's because of the books, which I'm here, happy today, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So, the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a encountered <unk> dropped into the couch my office took off the shoes and he told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class mate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the Hebrew stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy to just move the head while we would get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> said Alex, and so I saw her was right.
You start working after that, you get home later, she has children later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to <unk>
But soon after my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life.
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like he was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, still not, but maybe <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they want, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex in their development.
This made out of Alex <unk> the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There's 50 million children in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one gets to age without the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! It's amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream a <unk> I want to look at it. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that shape your life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
People in the '40s, not <unk>
This public is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up the second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change ourselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any time in life, and we know that the female fertility gets to its top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to put them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to the language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the slaves are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time <unk>
Researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> gave them names <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think that happens when you get <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then all the days, every day, interesting <unk> like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship I'm not going to notice.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I'm going to start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, but then somewhere around the '30s, crashed the music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit end, but it won't be <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure at the age of 30 and so many of you start a career, to pick a city, to pick a city, and have two or three children in a much smaller period.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful even to do everything once to the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You notice you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma got to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work on art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
And we did often in our <unk> but then she would wake up herself to say, "One doesn't choose his family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cry for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning I was hanging out with his many <unk> but then he was seeing the empty space that goes on after the words -- "In favor of <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of me if I give you <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I was to just sit while the decade <unk> on Emma went on.
So for the next weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that it was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: This is this: this: capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that they want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that we shouldn't count, that by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that he was working jobs and did it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you back to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds just as much as who you know, what they know about, how they think about, and where do they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes from outside of its closest circle.
Things come from what they're called weak ties friends of friends of friends.
Yeah, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have any work.
But half no other half won't, and the weak links are the way we get into this group.
Half the work created never <unk> then meeting the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
<unk> but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when she has a partner and shapes her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit at the head that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with whoever <unk>
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who was working on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That offer work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the living thing.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This guy with a man who won consciously <unk>
He loves his new career, he loves her new family, and I sent a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not good enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are kind of airplanes coming out of the Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, to the age of 21, or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their own identity, and use their weak connections, you pick your family.
Don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in <unk> consulting for a job that was even more <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to graduate students in the public schools in New York schools.
And like any teacher, we have tests and tests.
I'm going to do assignments.
When I work it back, <unk> grades.
What I called the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones that had a better performance had no test I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in <unk> in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn <unk> and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios. And in every study my question was, who has successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We try to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do in competition.
We studied professors who are working in the very difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of learning their <unk>
Do we associate with no private companies, wondering what about the marketers of work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, arose a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
The determination is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not at speed.
A few years ago, I started to study the determination of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my questionnaires of determination and then I waited about more than a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly more likely to figure out, even when the <unk> in every single one that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety of testing the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> matters is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most striking thing about determination is how little it knows about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How have the determination to resolve children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong job ethic.
How do I keep them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the particular determination is not related or even related inversely to the talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, <unk> to start everything again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most distressing memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that time, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single person from every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic, <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic tragedy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read signals from traffic menus from restaurants, to understand the basic idea of Web <unk> or newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it may be possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if it was shouting, <unk> I am <unk> I am a symbol that's actually <unk> in the form of it called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call it <unk> these eight characters.
These are building blocks so they think a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old man, two are company, three are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch out your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations of it.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a dead tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two <unk> it becomes very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A <unk> put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> Was there someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, watch care is <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing as a Chinese <unk> Chinese.
So after we meet the <unk> we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the earth of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains, stacked one on the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to get out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The film took its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand for it.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex <unk> shows <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The reality really took the rise of the last 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another film whose <unk> a metal and a guy named a metal and a kid who was a <unk> <unk> a girl in a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
Do you use magical <unk> to beat armies generated by <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most respected and even <unk> and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did see Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Three years old.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  So, he slid in the room, and he was impressed as a foot of his leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what it is.
They would be themes of value, perseverance and <unk>
He would have the feeling that Luke get one to an army to <unk>
So let's put this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win the film?
We do good <unk> with all of them and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to them, OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital <unk> the force in movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence of male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give us the right framework that would have served to navigate around the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected the students to begin to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> in front of you.
But they send a message to kids, although them, they are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to protect the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, as real and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all days continues to appear in classic after <unk> each of them about a kid or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year -- this year eventually came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when they came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic years and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do, in the film, there is more than a female character who has <unk>
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the boy than you so much like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet rarely I see it in the film we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a sense of consensus than this is a Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't happen <unk>
And I don't think that's because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in an embassy where men and women hide during the hostage.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door, and say, "Get off to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's take it into the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have native actors in them.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a bigger number than this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it said, right?
In the United States, one in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you can't <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to do it.
We have tools and our willingness to be <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> -- is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is changing radically.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter who was his favorite character of Star Wars Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that they know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people in order to engage their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and struggle with only more stories where their job is to join a team -- maybe a team led for women, perhaps a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people.
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was looking for biscuits of sea on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
You're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I joined <unk>
I started to see forms and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, on a love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 1,300 miles length.
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we can use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta, of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process using fake color, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes in the landscape of the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians of the <unk>
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there were this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings than the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge continuous <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per square miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved into this and covered in the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball gloves there.
So, we use NASA data for NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where they were going to get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly high than you see within the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take them in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud we found a dense layer of symmetrical objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire in the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> quartz work, which shows that there was a jewelry shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire these are the stones that were <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Empire of the Middle Empire it probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago:
So sharing knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to me, TED was not founded in 1984 to make C.
Do the ideas really occur in 1984 B.C. in C. B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts a search for marine shells.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to just close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese group.
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go back to their front door.
I need to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of his house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that goes on on their side, and the wheels that ends up in <unk> places that end up in the front <unk>
The <unk> in the hall, or whatever there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> with your hand.
From their chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speech.
You can feel your blue password on your nose.
You can smell the tone of you, and you go out to be about to get into the mouth.
They walked around and enter your living room.
In the room, and doing peak of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing over your middle <unk> singing <unk> And I'm <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of regular bricks and from the oven. They come to you <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> <unk> only once.
It takes the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
It took full poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people need to be phenomena from nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, who had one of the best memories <unk>
And I said, "Well, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have average memory.
Everybody participating in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We were trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques invented two and two years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speakers, that the medieval <unk> used to memorize their <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the classroom of competence, and <unk> who is a brilliant English and brilliant English and a little bit <unk> she said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards in live television on TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties over the writing of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin America, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> and grown was not one thing as rare as it may seem like this today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
We have changed the culturally, and I would say that they have changed also as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a <unk> memory and <unk> is this such singular competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, whether it has brains in a sense, structural brains or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, which is their brains as <unk> as <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> found that in the memory champions <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is running as an armed race where every year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of playing <unk> who he's about to try to memorize him in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order.
It's in half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these computer, absolutely all the techniques used to the end of the end is cut to one concept that psychologists call <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> he says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you -- there's a man called <unk>
That's her last name.
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
What do you get?
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. There's no relationship anymore.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They get good when they go home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when I did that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some return later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two and two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you haven't brought a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> her poem from memory, and he was <unk> and as soon as it was -- the hall of the <unk> was <unk>
Tell us all.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies to be <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting in.
So you couldn't afford the <unk>
It's a tragedy behind the other.
They stopped outside the only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, shut my eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting on each grade.
I took the family of my hand <unk> where their loved ones were on the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions a word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I let them tell you that the first 10 words of history that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to do it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if I told you who was sitting on the horse know brown in his <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and image of images that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do this memory in the same way that would have done it, if they had invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're in the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely crazy and crazy image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth thing that you would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their speakers, not word for a word -- which is going to confuse himself but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space of space in space.
The phrase "In first <unk> would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a long idea about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got up the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the way back to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old woman <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What this is actually about doing is to improve increasingly the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security security with tape leave only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of one fellow of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it into a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and numbers on the phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just so only tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of the memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift company, but it's not the case.
The big memories <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We were focusing on the way we focus on deeply.
The palace, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
We put a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us are not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what I would like to leave you today, and I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left myself to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side, we are going to be so <unk> that we don't even want to be able to process it in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we would just build a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there you were all over looking at the television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone looked at me and every time I went out and I would go back into a towel -- everyone was looking at me.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> insecure and I hated it.
<unk> that journey hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and of division of areas -- but those connections are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would think of you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it so that we based on a building two and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums art <unk>
And in the 20th century in the U.S., we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because to build things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> Public <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this <unk> columns -- red brick -- that they leave <unk> what it is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, was finished with another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, be so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects that are constantly driving new technologies -- new solutions for the forms of life today.
We have <unk> and <unk> so far away from the people.
All of black, this is telling us, you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back to these symbols and <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we would go ahead and go ahead and over again. So we have done it over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I had the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called the <unk>
It's got to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small on a <unk> scale.
It's really very hard.
So we go down to the 1980s, and we started bringing these symbols.
<unk> the new side of the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
And we add <unk> and we added a lot of new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into <unk> that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
The <unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
That's crazy.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with an infinite bit of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are feeling frustrated and we started to make <unk> the pendulum going back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols of <unk> we now have new computer design techniques by computers, and we found ourselves with new amounts of shapes that are attached to other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Normally, I would pass it back in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academic and public critics were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in two and a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical ways, how are you possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing made the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new millennium, with other star architect <unk>
She went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened in these very few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, and actually began to happen with all the architecture.
Think of architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> can be <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; it means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings -- before I knew if I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> of the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media to communication, it starts to make it faster and faster, until it will be in both extreme extremes -- and it will actually be the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can do <unk> symbols with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, as was a part of the community, and like drawings looked like the product done, no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your history, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when you carry these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experiment with innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell you that there is no single answer to what a library can be in today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words and drawings and type of drawings and you're no longer a <unk> audience that doesn't take something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style of style to another one is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
That means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical <unk> historical brick based on ideas of what's supposed to be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings <unk> the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage, in Philadelphia Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can <unk> <unk> on the East <unk> East <unk> and raise half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no longer matters if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how to build it, which matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make buildings more and more <unk>
We have been waiting for everyone to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot at play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the more unequal spaces, the local libraries of local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And he does it in that great great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
You laughed and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do that. And so when stopped doing this?
How is it that we are not really happy with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for a Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, he only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends or school is told to school -- they don't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he posts it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager who receives these responses into one of the stages of their most emotionally emotionally vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his fourth room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes on with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what's not.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what it's rigged digitally.
What is the most prominent thing in somebody's life in front of someone in front of someone in front of you who are normal in a rural context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> size will still dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids aren't immune to this.
Like the ones of the superheroes of the sport, and the singers came out.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and whether they're good <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as taxpayers are a society and the business development field.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the discussions of class.
One in five are not going to be taught at all at all days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the training season if you don't think you think good enough, specifically if you don't believe you are thin, you spend a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about it.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be clear of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you are.
The low self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers in time are doing fewer physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diets.
They have low self-esteem.
They're easier for people around them, and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what they make more powerful decisions like the consumption of alcohol and of drugs, diet -- surgery, aesthetic surgery, <unk> relationships at early early ages and without protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women believe that they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day that they don't feel secure with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
And so we have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are key points to anyone willing to provide a body education education that works.
Education is a fundamental one, but to address this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
You challenge the current status of how women are seen and talked about in our circles.
It's not good to count on the input of our <unk> politicians or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the <unk> of an Olympic athlete on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can begin to do that by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you. When was the last time I would take a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and our businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow all their person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people out there really making a difference in a <unk>
So by making a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out on the big screen because we only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they have never come to be who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who have in mind?
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
Her <unk> at its <unk>
It could just be the woman who is at two car seats -- what would it mean for her to be released from that voice <unk> in his interior, he would fight them by not having long legs, getting more skinny, a more flat belly -- more than little <unk>
What would it mean for us if we were <unk> this and we would tell its potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are back to everyone.
But let's bring our children the truth.
And so what you think is that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they feel.
They bring self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age will become a safe shift agents in exchange tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November 11, 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the <unk> de Defense <unk>
It initially was initially innocent but being prisoner for other <unk> and the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 iconic New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations facility.
So luckily, those plans were <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb to 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't get back.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being him an engineer who had an engineer with an American mother, an American mother, elementary school.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
In experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, throughout religion, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible means for everyone to live like them.
A few months before her arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends, he and some friends had been going to training him in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which we didn't know our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got older, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave him a little orange light on the goal and to surprise everybody, especially of me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
How father, such son.
All of all, the comment had a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved over 20 times, that instability during my childhood did not allow me to do a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable with someone already now to pack up and go to another city.
As it was always my new face of the class often was the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white -- but to be the new thing about the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, so I was <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I raised my opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or religion.
So how could the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in test my thinking, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a <unk> victim almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took several days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work on Bush <unk> a park in <unk>
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience resulted in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the happened I had a chance to work with gay actors there, on a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So I could contrast the stereotypes of stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be <unk> but I know what is to be a trial for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every morning, Jon Stewart asked me to be <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my figure <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not on vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that will keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired tired of someone who's suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
He changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and started a new life.
So why decided I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, some of them is about taking your violence to be able to hear my story and understand that there's a better way, which is a better way, that even though I gave myself to this ideology violent and <unk> I didn't get to get myself <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism talking, against those <unk> acts as rejection to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity -- I'm just showing you here as evidence that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your <unk>
It has emotion, anger and happiness.
It's got memories, like a time of your childhood when you project your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice in your conscious thought.
The heart of the film is you experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a real internal movie, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know that I have an awareness of it.
I don't have certain that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If you were not conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, for nature, is objective objective to evolve.
<unk> nature is subjective <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the 20th century, we would experience that vision.
The psychology is studying the behavior of the limit the neuroscience of studying the brain -- but never no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a great poster of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy at the fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of meaning.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas do of the brain are doing and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
There are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, not addressing the real core mystery of this <unk> Why all physical processes in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is this an internal movie movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all kind of emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they work -- how they become adapting and <unk> the living organisms -- they're all questions about how this target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is that all of this accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it will work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that was not working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get into this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We used us to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains some of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, I think consciousness, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly of an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that in the beginning, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective world film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what we have to do, is to explain brain functions to look at the brain behaviors -- and this is what it takes to do is it <unk>
Well, more power for him.
So that's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of the purely <unk> consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
The physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as building <unk> space and mass.
It sets fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they think principles, and the world is building the world.
Sometimes the list of fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, Newton's laws and <unk> the basic law as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, mass, then for a question of logic, you have to make it <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it is not a matter of science, in a way.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, space -- the mass, the mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want to want very simple laws that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws just so simple that we can get them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious not only humans, dogs dogs, flies, of flies, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when he thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of very crude feeling, subjective some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for different people, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason is the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that will <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There's always information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> in mathematical methods.
It has a measure of integration of information integration called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a half a half a half of information integration as a pretty significant degree of consciousness, <unk>
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there will be a level of consciousness, different from zero.
In fact <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the fact that underlies the bottom.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming from?
From vision <unk> the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not being outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had nothing to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a master of it.
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has an processing processing processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you get all these very serious ethical problems about the ethics of development of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the human consciousness, the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, as the audience in a TED Talk, we have a TED collective consciousness, a internal film for this whole group of TED, which is different from the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing than the second thing to be universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thought contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve overnight at night tomorrow.
But I think we're finally going to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, my younger sisters.
It was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a community for a community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem right.
She hasn't got anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a long time looking at the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class 11 <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about law enforcement for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in the wheels, they talk about things they were sitting on the school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had a experiences with disabled people as an inspirational objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair and you're probably waiting for you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have lied to disability.
Yes, you've sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make it happen.
And over the last few years, we have been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You might have seen one, from the girl without drawing a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we would bring a group of people to benefit from another group of people.
So in this case, we would have the disabled people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, however bad my life might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times you have tackled strangers <unk> to express that you think that I am a brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, these images are forcing people to benefit from people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
So let's get a few things.
But the things that we overcome is not the things that you might think.
They're not things relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because you've sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And I honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by <unk>
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all.
However, I don't know that I'm <unk> I am <unk>
You know, I think this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things they fall over --  -- you know, the very clever trick of how to charge the cell phone on the cell phone at the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles with a stretch of stairs has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen will not make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not being considered not to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> by getting up of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid in the 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his teacher is a <unk>
disability doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so I don't get <unk>
When people think actually <unk> think in "Minority <unk> and on Tom <unk> hands on the air, but reality reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know them, because reality augmented our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what a professional person is in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would fit with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running by the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a <unk> man. <unk> <unk> <unk> trying to fill it up with all his self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So I put some videos to show you what this is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that there lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like a feeling of being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
A <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know many of you know.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man in a rollercoaster that was inspired by his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a video of Adrian Adrian across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of Connecticut.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball on the <unk> or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
We can make reality augmented reality when I put them, and the owners and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. Give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> so that they play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> from the field <unk> and then on the walls.
They were more fast, because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see your next move you shown in front of you, on a plastic <unk> that you wear in <unk> You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or they memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they are <unk> and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties -- as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But reality reality is not just a manual of strategies <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way of gathering information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones have a information <unk>
And so this <unk> good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will just stop <unk>
It's also to <unk> Who <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they're <unk>
He went off the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your Norden bombsight is given to you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't do it, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
It's going to take the protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there's an open mechanism.
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees on its bombsight a patch of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of a sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as a bread and fat, like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality for empathy among human beings, to show somebody how it is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how corrosive are their actions from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it's being <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality reality comes close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as all of us.
Thank you.
I recently got back after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I spent the South <unk> of the southern County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is essentially <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more of 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has become <unk> as such, so that every one of it releases away from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body drops against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bones, some of which will create vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that not, normally they would be used in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize the death of the death that was <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been before they were to take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have formal training.
So let's go through to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who were describing the suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, federal officers, and psychologists train the new government officers, and we train the new official officers,
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the <unk> <unk> of last year when he got a call from a possible subject subject sitting at the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason talking with an official of the Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown over here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, he was curious about <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, he said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
So this kind of nice guy and intelligent from New Jersey just had to take your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage of suicide affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it was <unk>
What do you find?
What does it say?
In my experience, there's not only to talk, but you need to listen to.
It will listen to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel it, because you probably don't get it."
You just get there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
So one way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing that you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still fairly <unk> but seeing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving back to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with her father the 19th of January.
It was never there.
I called the police officer and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and they reported me that the <unk> car was down on the bridge.
You've seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> in the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end up.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio called a radio call by a possible subject subject of the bridge near the bridge north.
I went off to the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half time, I heard how Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to go back to this day return on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did they do that <unk> and <unk> hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I'm <unk>
I was left to talk to you and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Afghan mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the events of the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin keeps Kevin with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I read Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> <unk> When I visited the General of San Francisco that night, you would take the patient.
I know I did have it <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and a <unk>
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspired by others.
suicide is not just something I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather will be <unk> with poison.
That act, in spite of finishing their own pain, robbery the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think they hurt another person.
They just want their own pain to go away.
So large, this is only achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls out of the bridge.
The incidents of those incidents I've been directly involved with only two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I ran my hand at three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one one percent or two of those people have said that the second they leave the fence was realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every one of us must help us to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but inside you you know what you are, and a question is, how do you tell you about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model I had finally achieved the dream that I'd had since a child.
My outside eventually I would get through my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to address later, when I look at this picture -- I'm thinking, you got it out of this picture -- <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, I'm just getting started.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my most agent will even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I had an <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my genital ones.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, and I was always wearing this shirt in the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that it's actually something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never love to share my story, not because it would think it's going to be bad, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still wore a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you done it in the <unk> <unk>
He said to me that if she <unk> she went out of <unk> <unk> and on the shirt. And that night, I won in the <unk> He won in the <unk> and he got a third <unk> over 40 slides.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was of queen of beauty of women, but I know I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to <unk> the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know what if you go to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I gave myself two <unk> to my name.
She was also associated with me when I was <unk> in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do the most sophisticated sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before we changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity paper means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt like I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living his truth, but that <unk> ended his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 November, we make a global vigil by the Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> Mike and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day no longer had no longer <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. Yeah. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I attended young women who have been <unk> I have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents could not embrace it, I took my mom and he would take my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other no. It's just identity identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to the birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes the issue doesn't have a block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents usually have known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts came up in 2011, by <unk> the <unk> National <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at human history, women's story is the history of the <unk> of violence, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born, a girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not banker and his father, and his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother, the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> so much for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when he was <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother <unk> but the daughter. The daughter just <unk> when it comes up, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home, and the school would tell her siblings.
At the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
Can you imagine?
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you guarantee it comes out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes called his father and his brothers and his brothers and her family, and if he would <unk> the code of that honor, the <unk>
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of the course of honor.
And there's one more standard of societies that's called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very <unk> very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and they embrace the decisions of their father and mother and women's decisions, even if they don't want.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If you get a very young one, you have to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so long before I was <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and called my daughter for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a
So you might ask, why should I mention a little girl tags in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for the child life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
A bar to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations to explore their potential for its future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of a visa Canadian Canadian and was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought it had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I went to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged going to go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to do it in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've collected all these good values in my school to girls and <unk>
I used education for <unk>
I gave my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of the <unk>
He taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk> lesson.
<unk> brothers and sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls <unk> to school.
Women were forced to wear <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls' girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to be around those people who kill and kill them when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog from the BBC, was offered her for the New York Times documentaries and he spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> worldwide.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and nine o'clock in October 2012, he was shot to <unk> in the head.
It was one day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he told my wife to my wife -- "I've got to <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please do not <unk>
<unk> the right question.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of the peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired to you and get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These very few words would have a lot to me, and I didn't come back again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital and I had migraine headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to be <unk> I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to do well. Please don't get <unk>
It was an comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't get his homework.
They fight with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What especially in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did not did.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you cling to a brain operation.
Are you still as smart or not?
Is it not going to be <unk> you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, about more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if he didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about <unk> combinations and mix of <unk> and try to stay in life.
More than I've ever saved a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would have to be able to get the dose <unk> because it doesn't really exist a map that will say it in <unk>
I started trying to test a different mix with a different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how little changes in the dose dramatically changed my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a kind of typical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was surprised when I looked at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that I had to the front, and it just didn't happen that way.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and what they have to do, and I've been better at the time for men.
What I was trying to do when I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to reclaim my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking of ideas.
I used to think almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference, how to contact those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> and <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind.
And so, after several years, I got to find the point right and I have a lot of great mental <unk> actually <unk> well sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use his imagination only to drive the world to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of his head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups of neuroscience.
Both of these used <unk> technology -- functional MRI imaging -- to represent the brain. So you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you get away, seeing that same image.
The column on the right is created by the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeating up in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the laboratory of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into the visual fields of <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains were <unk> their brains to create a great pool of reactions to the video sequence.
Then I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer -- using only the brain information on the scan of the scan -- to show what it looked like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're well near doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, you create the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the scanning brain scanning systems available today, and the resolution of a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new kinds of projected techniques to projection by images, even me with the recent outcome of <unk> first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the road.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get larger resolution is with larger, but at this point, smaller magnets are only offering small improvements at the resolution, doesn't increases by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the bigger magnets make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant and brilliant solutions.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, they were able to create structured magnetic patterns -- we would go to radio frequencies that are <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns that we can actually increase the information that you can get in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be ridiculous, using it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few options that open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be telling some person for the first time your love or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation for which you have through your life.
So all my mind is a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet to be a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it to happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope that by the <unk> of my <unk> and I had a little bit <unk> my head asked me a little child, "Hey, you're a guy or a <unk>
And there'd be uncomfortable silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would go inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised my next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was just prepared to go into the female issues at the table.  I had the <unk> of Betty <unk>
<unk> dates out.
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I was <unk>
So I took a little bit a little bit down and I went down and I went down to my backs a four-year-old girl with a pink dress and looking at what's not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> a little girl with a question: "Are you <unk>
So I took a little bit close to it, again, I got back to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a <unk>
I have a short hair like the one boy like the one guy, and I saw baby clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more from the kind of little <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it, they're just like, "Oh, no, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was a hard conversation than I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know how color the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why out out of my closet more difficult than out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who had <unk> in banking and rotates is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your son from five years that you are going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what we're hard to do about how hard it is to make us feel better or worse in relation to our own, and we need to just feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made for a living.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the <unk> lesbian prepared to fight any four years old she would walk in.
It was frozen by fear -- <unk> in a corner of my dark closet my dark grenade -- and the moving only is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't capture that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was at the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and by making my homework <unk> and I was making a <unk> <unk> and <unk> walked around the tables and eventually came to one where my parents were my parents, people who knew me years ago.
And after I speak a moment, one of the women I cried to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
Do you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite <unk> show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes to show desperately his support, to get me knowing that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the Scud <unk>
It might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for how authentic you want.
That's how hard the hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three of the <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
You have an armor. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor, but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other people need to know that they are also <unk>
Number two: Be direct -- just <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they are gay, <unk>
If they say their parents maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be done for that.
And some of you can get out safe, <unk> for what they've done, but they're never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, one productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of it is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this it made it as a criticism of computing <unk> as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I set up a program to try and understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth and Earth from Earth or intelligence from the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence -- it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at some time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so that's why I claim this is the same question that the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be properly finely to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will increase the diversity of possible future diversity.
Finally, in the planning of <unk> movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, since a number of years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent of one E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action or to maintain the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yeah, to an impending future time.
In a nutshell, to intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain our open.
And so, having on this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
What is it so <unk> it?
We have the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find inside.
<unk> <unk> could be able to pass multiple animal tests to play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without the right thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for running robotics and <unk> technologies for human assistance.
This use of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals are able to cooperate pulling people out of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, restoring their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly <unk> and keeps success the good net well.
This is an <unk> capacity for health care -- in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to grow around the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in economic defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all flow of one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if <unk> intelligent machines would be a <unk> rebellion there.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion that we have to do in reverse.
It's not that the machines get smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the contrary, that the urge to take control of all future possible future is a most fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually come out of control, instead of being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
You often ask me, how do you look for targets <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to make the descendants of that statement to help them build artificial artificial <unk> or help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at an inflection point in human history, something between the dawn of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've expanded so much our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a spatial telescope that measures the faint light intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that they go.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
So together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their <unk>
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of worlds that we could potentially improve our own planet is embedded in the weight of humanity.
<unk> year was the <unk>
<unk> and ice ice that has been with us from now for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused in global scale have moved very rapidly to our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a scientist in the weather, not <unk>
It's that I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know <unk> our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it's a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be a potentially habitable world shown that by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> tracks their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission is taking samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose its <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> you remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> ideas compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still left by <unk> places that are actually <unk> with Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places of the Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests in thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets going to get a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly habitable the Earth.
For a lot I like exploration exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to safeguard humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the <unk> actually will be later in the <unk> boats --  Thank you.
But the targets for exploration exploration, and preservation of the earth is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They just get closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and hostile areas of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment called the <unk> paradox.
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, realizing that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Indus paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are to protect the origin of the planets that we build this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization will save us from ourselves, but digital preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put the hostile environments to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would take my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the lunch table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all were fine closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> might take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I could not go back home from my friend of Jeff to go through night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and the next morning, my passport and my suitcase.
It will be expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was going to have a good time.
I'm a career neurologist and I know a little bit about how the brain under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in place that would happen to be bad things.
Or at least, if things are bad things happen, you know, the probability of it is a total catastrophe happening.
So I started thinking about it, but until one month later, my thoughts didn't know.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written a few years earlier, known as <unk>
Everybody knows what's <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might get wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
So I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you get a place for things that are missing easily.
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science supporting this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where it's good, where the fish are where the fish, which places where the family trees live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and still could find their nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing car keys, <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook up with the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For their <unk> a particular drawer in it.
For your reading, it's a particular <unk>
If you get a place and they're <unk> with it -- your stuff is always going to be there when they <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone, a picture of your credit cards a picture of his credit card license, you know, <unk> yourself in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases yourself.
The <unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best point, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to make them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all decision-making decisions and actually make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from the fact that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I get the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart disease, <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you're going to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question you have to do then, a statistic to ask for which most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who need to take a drug or submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it must think about what kind of statistic <unk> it's <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not due to the doctor, and if it's fault of somebody is about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needed to deal with the most widely <unk> which believe that it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research research research <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I know the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or another event <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, let the effects <unk> Yeah?
For this particular medicine, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include these <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, <unk> for five percent is not very likely to go to me, still just to take the <unk>
But just a moment.
So remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this over time, so you don't have to make the design chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they needed or not to take the <unk>
I just say you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this thing that we need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that it is done in the biggest men in the late men -- <unk> from prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
That's how it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case is produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can ask to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to do this on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a number of a lot of times, you want a shorter life off of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot longer to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change it in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face with a predator with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You might be lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the thought thought, rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail once in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> are going to be able to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to stop the bad things on the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor I installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't been <unk> and lots of email messages I've never seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite symbol for me.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there that you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over time, it was mixed with local waves, and we developed the language that we now know as a <unk>
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country following blind their rules, bring together behaviors and <unk>
So how do I understand sound from?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So, I've learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the potato bag <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, Make it not <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> for going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do the self with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic nursing there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces -- and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has gone into my art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that you might be able to get back to me and my artistic job, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain an temporary form of value -- something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to get it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be capturing and expressing on the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for you to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divides in many different <unk>
If a <unk> different parameter for each finger while you play the piano, like facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of your hand and like that, as the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you cut it up just one bar <unk>
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only one key key would change the chord it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signature signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through contact glasses.
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you look at it and <unk> the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to be convinced from <unk>
"All religions.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led to me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> dawn.
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how far the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to spend a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> once.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> I would think automatically at the same time."
Look at it. Look at the right hand, <unk> left hand.
We have <unk> through head and chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
Everyone with your hands.
Now we're going to do it as much as the head as the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or at the same time."
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, third. Please move back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. Everybody happens in your head and the chest. But they make it very different.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and <unk> just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, no sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not to learn to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to <unk> to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, can you fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "Can you tell you everything, but then you've got to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble bubble or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults would lie to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not really good to clean each other.
The whole time -- I'm now an adult and teaching citizen and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, I <unk> the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something <unk>
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these large ships and networks, to collect those plastic bits of plastic to study it under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put this information on a map.
But lasts to an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats too.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work -- so the children are very <unk> too.
And I'm going to tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great, and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic bits of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> children get a lot with robots.
And then we created what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we end up in lunch.
And we will transform light and web cameras and <unk> it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic bits floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We put this step step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I would investigate my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, they look at the Internet, and the Internet is <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using your hands, in <unk> the world's largest world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also in brown color and when everything is battery, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce normal <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we send them to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was looking for a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and a French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it <unk> giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power nearby to water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution for <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the coast of <unk> and most of the time, it has pretty secure, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned every year since the accident and researching other scientists, the land, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> parents don't know it.
But every night we go to the center of <unk> here is the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did that because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all your life.
Together with them with them to discuss the data that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate rain.
With this, we were able to notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a mile of the nuclear power, and with the fishing aid of the zone we were collecting sediments from the sea with a sediment of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales -- also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal wood, chemistry, some of our biology, you can basically build it almost out there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where children of children can become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or well, we can help in global age mobility transforming their standard lawn chairs in new autonomous vehicles.
Plastic plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children is lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as scientists, creators, <unk> we have to prepare the next generation for the environment and people, and so that it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One puts it on the environment, the other one thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble and he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information about it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made of <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and architects in order to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores are thin <unk>
<unk> on the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that varies their functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my worldview <unk> twice as much as every designer and architect to work currently between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These are two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right and the right, analysis and synthesis, shown on the two screens after me.
My job at the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
I'll probably tell you why now?
Why wasn't it possible about it 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment in history, where we were <unk> four disciplines that offer designers to access the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my students' hands.
We design objects, products, products, and tools and tools across scale, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a service that some day not very far away, print <unk> buildings and graphics to nanoscale <unk> and graphics to nanoscale <unk>
So here we have <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is the only size of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second made of a single piece, <unk> on the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with flexible printing collaborator <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull, combines rigid materials and <unk> at the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution, and to the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same structural structural chair, and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, I went back to the nature of <unk> and designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties -- they vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by producing other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> the material material.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sending the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there was no difference between trunk, and sheets and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made up trees with twigs, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects were made from a single piece?
Let's get a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material to get the kind of material from the tree and fruit of fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year per organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune in to the <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of plastic husks -- <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical <unk> we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print structures at a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single material that would spend 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why are we continuing to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria genetically engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> <unk> and if it grows even more at windows.
<unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part two: for objects designed for <unk> put in the sea, and they will bring life into the sea, and they put on the ground, they will grow up a tree.
That fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control its flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology, like our liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals that were <unk> new biological backgrounds inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
A light turns into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract tract that will help you bring these bacteria and that they would take their function.
So we started making those channels in the human body, <unk> the material properties of material <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they get more transparent.
This <unk> digestive system when you stretch from one end to the other, 200 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times as our physical intestine are.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are living last creatures -- only half of them are <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we were able to create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the fabric of the power and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
In order to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer printing <unk> material.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is not going to be about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or matrix, put those fibers in each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is turned into the environment, create a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> both of the forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would get a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different places, and we've discovered that the way, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are up to death inside its <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we saw that we can design these <unk> we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew these silk worms were going to be dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, are sort of silk worms about structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to match us.
We put it carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as the <unk> <unk> were <unk> and <unk> <unk> and life starts again like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
Al <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk, they give all this pavilion for integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we're <unk> silk worms -- <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk path.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk by a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to bring life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a two of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a inspired design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design, which demands for us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked this?
You can touch your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art site more, he played the guitar with a punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I get involved in it, and I will let myself absorb and feel <unk> I've found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing to deny all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk>
I was worried about having fear of commitment, or to be densities, or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and all these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, you learned it from culture.
So what do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what they were going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make beautiful responses into children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
You get the <unk>
So this question is done over and over again as we grow in different ways, a lot of high school students are asking you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise in before you take the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, doesn't inspire dreaming of dreaming that they might be.
In fact, it does right right now, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even adults -- maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what's that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a breath that I say.
It could help if you divide it into three parts: multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use some other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was okay with multiple disciplines.
Barbara Barbara refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or you can get it to your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like <unk> or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here is three superpowers here.
One: synthesis.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the intersection.
And Rachel <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, traveling mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates Jewish jewelry.
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So there is new ideas.
And <unk> with all its background, can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower, <unk> is learning quickly.
When the <unk> we're interested in something, we're going to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we can <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time talented time.
As a stupid pianist, an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the simplest mechanical mechanics when their practices was beginning to write their thumb, and this ability to write a compelling launches for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to get to what you would have -- even if at the end of the end, it was <unk>
Is that possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform in whatever thing you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other <unk> maker, sometimes a <unk> <unk> sometimes a teacher, and sometimes apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of its clients.
The Magazine Magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to <unk> to meet the market needs that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas -- fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have a complex problems, and we have a complex problem, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> on the belly of knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and putting together ideas, and <unk> offers a ample knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But all of us should design lives and careers that we have to engage with how we are connected.
And, unfortunately, to <unk> most of them will be told to just be more like their <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing you carry out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> your inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just come from being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with her many passions.
Keep their curiosity through these <unk>
We have the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> took her to a psychiatric psychiatric
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After her death, he had a <unk> and they found weird plate and found out in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising thing.
If I would have been living today, we couldn't give her more help than <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
Since <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections, many treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But a little bit of progress in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's percent now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait for 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one in two of them.
In other words, there is the probability that you have to go through your years with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or loved with Alzheimer's.
It's only in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs will increase a five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> booms are.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death of all over the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that you can't cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than from other diseases than we've invested less time and money on the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a number annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a larger cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world is Alzheimer's -- Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of them, even scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plate and <unk> strangers on the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper it folds out like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these dots <unk> you end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left in the outside.
So this makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step of it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in the most part, the cords have reduced the cords and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a couple of videos from what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick with each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in such an early stage, then we see that we are going to live and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we zoom in, we can <unk>
In the case of other conditions, patients and their families and their families have seen more research and <unk> pressure industry.
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, caregivers victims of their loved day, day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's isn't in most cases a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
You know, I talked to them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I was looking at this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions, and then you both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you ever heard somebody else's <unk>
And <unk>
<unk> are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> I really love <unk> to your partner what you like to do, or he would be very honest this time, and I gave things that you have have ever known.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a very detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to kill them.
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I'll send it to the neocortical column, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask, keep it together yet.
And the reason I think you ask this is because I have done this question again and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I was published the article was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times is probably a few thousand noticed.
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was printed on a Friday at night, and now the Saturday, this was in the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I had called the Today the <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received over eight million <unk> and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster confidence by thinking about thinking about different experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an international news has been international news.  And that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were calling or <unk> what every day they did for weeks, always, they were doing first the same question: keep together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email from my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was interviewed with radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put a red.
I think this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should hope that people feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article called San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers to test the study on them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public onset together.
I had TV interviews, and he refused the orders of photos of us from us.
I think he was afraid to become the icons <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of the one that I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know whether the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really were, I mean, if it was able to make love <unk> not just an adventure, but love <unk> love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel that could answer.
My relationship was just a couple of months and I felt, mostly people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and in addition to <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 little questions that interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at <unk> foster <unk> between college students, using what they were doing, called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt more closely after making a number of recent studies, as they used <unk> protocol -- as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of police and community, and they have used it among people in our opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I took last summer, and combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be overwhelmed by it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get rid of the person who would do it.
Well he did a pause.
I think she only wants us to be friends.
I said, "But better friends?
<unk> they did have been able to get better known to get the research on.
The <unk>
So, I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's all about love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I turned to the science.
And so I did everything that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment that I just did this for the book that I was writing -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I joined the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to just like I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful from one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably well as they can demand me.
So what I'm looking for for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story was told that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk -- and this is a very unequal story, because they love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that I ask, still follow together?
And his content with an answer for an answer.
So more than a question, would I propose we ask more difficult questions, like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love with the things when things are <unk> and how to figure out when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how do you live in your partner?
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more stressful conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known study, and I was applying a study designed to create romantic love, we still get together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's true, but at the time, there were not considered everything that that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't find how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much times I have to continue to do that choice without knowing before he always choice or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody so generous, kind of kind and fun and have expressed that election in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, in return, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what you do -- and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to get happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's scary, but that's one of the bargain to love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> <unk> and I was sort of a forest <unk>
<unk> in New York City a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more details go forward.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years.
I took a box of wood, and I would put a dollar ticket a dollar, and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the weird <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's funny because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and make <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was making a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, I covered her in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and he was brought to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite is going to happen. In some way it seemed to go from size, as if it was that we would take text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs, weird bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
Can I flow from drawing the same as you do about a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own <unk> of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of natural <unk> of human beings with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use a glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing in a window and then over the other window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition there.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
It's 50 feet long.
It's twice a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where creatures with animals are headed by the <unk> ready to commit suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird who is tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the bin Laden, there are all kinds of rare things that can be found if you look very well at the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be a mythological thing that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of narrative.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird summit and spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, long one tail of snake that joins the <unk>
But anyway, your tail turn to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go out, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made from 1986.
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material or material be a dictionaries or magazine or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of file, as a way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide them.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a small cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can get the <unk>
I'm going to tell you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, it has a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a one-party body in half.
This has two heads of his, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that go out and come into the head of this strange statue of this.
There's a little scene of the forest inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a writer, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have effect against pain, first of the stomach, and other organs.
You take a pill -- it's the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug would lead into your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- these are to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the blood <unk>
But they also are known for their side side effects on their most negative, because in time it takes to get into the current current and worse and worse than the time it takes to reach its fate, which is where it's more important in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go into the blood flow of the patients that are being transferred to regular drugs.
However, after treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> do the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery of diabetes, they can be used for anything, including transportation transport of medicines.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes, which opens up and close the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "What is that <unk>
We send a little bit powerful and powerful laser beam on the living cell with HIV -- while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser comes through the cell, while the cell is absorbed the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device from three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the site.
The second head, which is a camera, is driving to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, and it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep stem cells.
Well, this doesn't seem very long.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. It's a cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Do you accept what these groups do when they're not shoot up.
My goal is to better understand these control agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent involvement to non-violent <unk>
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding groups are key to solving most of the conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute among states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements in 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be able to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know so well the reasons why they do, how they do, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed armed struggle and policy policy is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking people.
We put a complex engine of <unk> radio stations and TV channels, and Internet sites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Public groups are also investing in a complex fundraising system, but through business businesses -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, will increase their funds, to create better and build their brand.
Public groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they build hospitals, they run professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering the population offering something that the state is not <unk> and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan <unk> by the war or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> it can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling a vacuum -- a gap by the government, and it allows them to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory in 2006 of Hamas Palestinian cannot be understood without to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups <unk> we just think of the violent side of it.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
They <unk> because they fill up gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups involved in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more sophisticated and sophisticated things are these organizations, less we can get it back to a state.
How about a group like <unk>
It's part of a territory, running all of its <unk> collect the trash, and they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without the state and hybrids and the weak in the Middle East, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap in non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in not military tools.
<unk> that government empty has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better at groups -- we will understand better what incentives to offer to foster violence from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- no military power can make some fights, but we will not give peace and stability.
To make these targets we need long-term investments to fill that safe <unk> to fill that government emptiness that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that to accept the <unk> label <unk> would be <unk>
I'm a <unk>
And therefore I gave myself a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a book, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> with the men and that they would say, <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who could be a feminist player.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and ugly word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asked too too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and cannot imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as being <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and <unk> and so much more.
We need to have in account of these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I listen to rap rap at all.
Though the letter degrades the women and I was struck by the classic <unk> classic <unk> the Yin of the Yin Yin is amazing.
Do we actually have your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my taste music.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, a collection of crap out of grass and maintaining <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and <unk>
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy tales, which come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, she is his election, and I'm not who I am to ask.
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise your children, I agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable to when they <unk>
So you get this problem.
<unk> the feminism thing that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women's women -- the <unk> and gay workers, and <unk> for white, white, <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist line.
What happens is this: As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put on a <unk> of <unk>
We hope that we would love perfection.
When we get older, I take them very happy from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as a <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of meaning that this tag is <unk> not to be able to accomplish with a little realistic expectations.
Take <unk> or like I call it the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk>
In the <unk> Music Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show at this star of poop embracing the feminism of feminism and to do to the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless arguments if it was or not a feminist.
He was able to get his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection is because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We're going far beyond critical criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism feminism for any woman, <unk> until there's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question or more good, one of the more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We have to recognize our <unk> to give the thing to be a little more brave.
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing a single supply supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when the bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three-year-old and four years.
It's two little girls and <unk> and <unk> and too brave. I want to grow up in a world.
They are going to be given to the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will become a lot easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies are not treating women more than <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish him in his magazine, participating in your project, or to work with you, until it doesn't have enough number of women, so much to participate in the way to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but they will encourage us to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help ourselves be even more including until more like us, to overcome the barriers to the decision <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts without embracing these <unk> our gains.
We can make these little decisions and expect our decisions to get to the top, to people in power filmmakers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make big decisions and more courageous, to create a durable and significant.
We can also tell our fear of good, well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not being <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you, especially because I <unk> my voice was stolen and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't believe I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And so I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and equally, I also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is all about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the realization that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we all can be a little courageous, when you get a little bit of such a <unk>
Right after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> to have visited <unk> or by being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things in this outbreak is that <unk> which can be lousy for a child with an immune system -- is one of the most precious diseases.
There is an effective vaccine against this since over half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the outbreak -- they hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly still <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines were <unk> and marked by being a mortgage fraud by the British Medical Group.
They don't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines are actually putting in danger to their children of being autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increasing estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her to talk about her to develop their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence followed stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of funding as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people to the Centers for Disease Centers what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis, and a better detection detection for explaining these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language don't <unk> the fears of a young mother who seeks to be on the face of their two-year-old son of two years of eye contact with you.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told you a story about what autism and how autism was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a psychiatrist psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article which describes 11 young patients which seemed to be <unk> worlds that seemed to <unk> domestic worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
You could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to panic by <unk> as though he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, I stated that I'd seen less than 150 cases of their syndrome while <unk> <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, let's give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had converted to nine percent of the 10 kids sent their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of lifestyle and child is caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, have been very carefully kept in a fridge that we don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 percent, before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval for.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of <unk> mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as they could without support for support, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
We put a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
He had a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw it was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse diverse.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics,
In other ways, these kids don't get into <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one ever noticed these children before?
But then I <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he got buried buried under the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember.
I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even an English translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speaking German, and he would fight him for her.
The document provides a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was running a clinical clinic with a Japanese school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's to teach children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
In his clinic in his clinic started with music, and kids follow their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described described as disability disability that required <unk> forms of support and spaces during the course of all of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's were their little teachers, and he got to help in the developing methods of education that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse variety that included an amazing variety of silence and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic people were common, and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in the Greek culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that we were taking the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and tomato model.
These changes didn't fell into <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked on it to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, hanging out by experts who knew what autism, but after <unk> acting of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents around the world know what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that they were expected to get the people with autism and their families finally put together the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful, seductive story of credible -- as bad as the <unk> theory.
If the current estimate of the prevention of prevention that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, right, the <unk> are one of the biggest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the past few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are for solving the new health advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding of the teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential for their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat of <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a whole brain.
Thank you.
